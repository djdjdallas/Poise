Moving from FetLife messages to meeting in person is exciting—but it requires care. The kink community has developed safety practices for good reasons.

Here's how to vet, verify, and meet safely, with templates for each stage.

## Before Meeting: Vetting Basics

### What You're Checking For

- Are they who they say they are?
- Do they have community reputation?
- Do their stories add up?
- Are there red flags in how they communicate?
- Would meeting them be safe?

### Information to Gather

**Basic verification:**
- Real first name
- General location
- How long in the community
- What events they've attended

**Community connections:**
- Do you know anyone in common?
- What groups are they active in?
- Can anyone vouch for them?

**Communication assessment:**
- Are they consistent?
- Do they respect boundaries in messages?
- How do they handle disagreement?

---

## Step 1: Extended Messaging

### What to Look For

During the message phase:
- Consistency in their stories
- Respect when you set small boundaries
- Interest in you as a person, not just your kink
- Willingness to answer reasonable questions
- No pressure to meet before you're ready

### Message Template: Asking About Community

> "Before we think about meeting, I'd like to know more about your community involvement. What events have you attended? Are you active in any local groups? Do we have any mutual connections?"

### Message Template: Getting Basic Info

> "I'm enjoying our conversation. Before we go further, I'd feel more comfortable knowing a bit more about you—what's your real first name, and how long have you been active in the community?"

---

## Step 2: Video Verification

### Why Video Matters

A video call before meeting:
- Confirms they look like their photos
- Shows how they communicate in real time
- Gives you a feel for their vibe
- Is reasonable to request

### Message Template: Requesting Video

> "I'd love to keep chatting, but before we plan to meet in person, I'd feel more comfortable doing a quick video call. Even just 10-15 minutes so we can see each other and chat a bit. Are you open to that?"

### If They Refuse

Red flag. Someone unwilling to video call before meeting may be:
- Hiding something about their appearance
- Not who they claim to be
- Not serious about your comfort

> "I understand privacy concerns, but a video call is pretty standard before meeting someone from online. If that's not something you're comfortable with, I don't think meeting in person makes sense for me."

---

## Step 3: Reference Checking

### Asking Around

Before meeting, especially for any kink activity:
- Message people who know them
- Ask event organizers
- Check their community interactions

### Message Template: Asking a Mutual Connection

> "Hey [name], I've been chatting with [person] and they mentioned you know each other. I'm considering meeting them and wanted to check in—what's your experience with them? Any concerns I should know about?"

### Message Template: Asking Them for References

> "Before we meet, I'd like to speak with someone who can vouch for you. Is there anyone in the community who knows you that I could reach out to? I'm happy to provide the same if you'd like."

### How They Respond Matters

Good sign: They readily provide references
Concerning: They refuse, get defensive, or claim nobody knows them

## Step 4: The First Meeting

### Where to Meet

**Good first meeting locations:**
- Coffee shops
- Casual restaurants
- Public bars
- Community munches (ideal—built-in vetting)

**Avoid for first meetings:**
- Their home or yours
- Private locations
- Anywhere you can't easily leave
- Play parties (until you've met in a vanilla setting)

### Safety Measures

**Before:**
- Tell a friend where you're going and who with
- Share their FetLife profile with your friend
- Agree to check in at a specific time
- Have your own transportation

**During:**
- Watch your drinks
- Trust your instincts
- Leave if something feels off
- Don't feel obligated to stay longer than comfortable

**After:**
- Check in with your friend
- Don't go to a private location this time
- Process how you felt about them

### Message Template: Setting Up the Meeting

> "I'd love to meet you. How about [coffee shop/restaurant] this [day]? Somewhere public works best for a first meeting—hope that works for you too."

---

## If They Push Back on Safety

### Common Pushback

- "Don't you trust me?"
- "This seems like a lot"
- "Real submissives don't need all this"
- "I've never had to do this before"

### How to Respond

> "These are standard safety practices in the community. Anyone experienced would understand that. If this is too much for you, we're probably not a good match."

Someone who resists basic safety measures is showing you who they are.

## Special Considerations

### Meeting for Kink vs. Meeting for Coffee

**First meeting (vanilla):**
- Public location
- No play expectations
- Getting to know each other
- Assessing compatibility

**If considering play later:**
- Multiple vanilla meetings first
- Detailed negotiation required
- References become more critical
- Consider community introduction (munches, events)

### If They're New to the Community

More caution needed:
- Can't be verified through community
- No track record to check
- Doesn't mean unsafe, but means less information
- Rely more on gut instincts and observable behavior

### Long Distance Considerations

If meeting someone from another area:
- Extra video calls first
- Meet in public for first in-person
- Don't go directly to private location
- Have a local contact in their city if possible

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Before Meeting

- Refuses video call
- Won't provide basic information
- Gets angry about safety questions
- Pressure to meet immediately
- Nobody can vouch for them

### At the Meeting

- Shows up looking different than photos/video
- Pressures you to leave the public space
- Dismisses your boundaries
- Seems different than in messages
- Makes you uncomfortable in any way

### Trust Your Gut

If something feels wrong, it probably is. You can always leave.

---

## After the First Meeting

### If It Went Well

- You can arrange another meeting
- Still take it slow
- Verify your impressions with second meeting
- Discuss what you're both looking for

### If It Didn't Go Well

- You don't owe them another chance
- You don't need to explain why
- Trust your assessment
- Move on without guilt
