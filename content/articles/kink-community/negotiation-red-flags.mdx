## FAQ

**What if I see a red flag but really want to play with them?**
The red flag is information. Your desire doesn't make it less concerning. Investigate further, but don't ignore warning signs.

**What if they have good reasons for the red flag?**
Maybe. But your safety comes first. Ask questions, but trust patterns over explanations.

**Should I tell them what concerned me?**
Optional. You don't owe explanation for declining. If you feel safe giving feedback, it might help them. But your safety first.

**What if I'm wrong about a red flag?**
Better to be cautious. The cost of avoiding a good partner is lower than the cost of ignoring warning signs about a dangerous one.
