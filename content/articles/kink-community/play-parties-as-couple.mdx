## FAQ

**Do we have to do everything together?**
No. Many couples play separately at play parties. Discuss what works for you.

**What if we have different comfort levels?**
Go with the more conservative comfort level, or separate activities within the space.

**Can we bring other partners?**
Depends on the party and your relationships. Negotiate with everyone involved.

**What if one of us wants to leave early?**
Have a plan for this. Maybe one leaves, maybe both. Don't trap someone who needs to go.
