## Using Both Together

### A Combined Strategy

Many people use both:
- **FetLife** for community, events, education
- **Feeld** for dating and meeting specific people

### How This Works

1. Use FetLife to learn, attend events, build knowledge
2. Use Feeld to find matches with shared interests
3. Vet Feeld matches through community (are they on FetLife? Do they attend events?)
4. Let community connections develop into dating on their own timeline

### Cross-Platform Vetting

When meeting someone from Feeld:
- Ask if they're on FetLife
- Check their community involvement
- See if you have mutual connections
- Use FetLife's reputation systems

---

## Privacy Considerations

### FetLife Privacy

- Pseudonymous (use a scene name)
- Not connected to real identity by default
- You control photo visibility
- Community is discrete but not invisible

### Feeld Privacy

- Connected to your phone
- Previously required Facebook (now optional)
- More tied to real identity
- Incognito mode available (paid)

**If privacy is paramount:** FetLife offers more separation from real identity.
