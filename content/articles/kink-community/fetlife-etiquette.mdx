Every online community has unwritten rules. FetLife's culture is shaped by decades of kink community norms, privacy concerns, and lessons learned from bad actors.

Here's what you need to know to avoid accidentally stepping on toes.

## Messaging Etiquette

### Before You Message

**Read their profile first.** If they've stated messaging preferences, follow them. "No messages from men" means no messages from men.

**Check relationship status.** Some people are owned/collared and require you to contact their dominant first.

**Look for "looking for" info.** If they're not looking for what you're offering, don't offer it.

### Your First Message

**DO:**
- Introduce yourself
- Reference something specific from their profile
- Be clear about why you're reaching out
- Keep it reasonable length (3-5 sentences)

**DON'T:**
- Start with "Hey" alone
- Lead with compliments about their body
- Assume they want to play with you
- Send sexually explicit content without consent
- Copy-paste generic messages

### Example Good First Message

> "Hi! I came across your writing about [topic] and really resonated with what you said about [specific point]. I'm [brief relevant info about you]. Would love to connect if you're open to it—feel free to check out my profile and let me know."

### If They Don't Respond

- Don't send follow-ups
- Don't call them out publicly
- Don't take it personally
- Move on

## Profile Etiquette

### Viewing Profiles

- Don't screenshot profiles
- Don't share profile information outside FetLife
- Don't mention seeing someone's profile in vanilla contexts

### What to Put on Your Profile

- Accurate, recent photos
- Honest information
- Clear statement of what you're looking for
- Respect for others' privacy (don't tag people without permission)

### What NOT to Put

### Posting in Groups

**DO:**

## Event Etiquette

### Marking Attendance

## Relationship Status Etiquette

### Respecting Structures

- If someone says they're in a closed dynamic, don't pursue them
- If someone is collared/owned, understand what that means before approaching
- Don't try to "steal" people from their dynamics
- Ask about relationship structure early if you're interested

### Hierarchies and Protocols

- If they have protocols (like needing permission to message), respect them
- Don't judge others' relationship structures
- What works for them isn't your business unless you're involved

## Privacy and Discretion

### The Golden Rule

- Document everything
- Report to moderators
- Reach out to community support
- Know your legal options if it causes harm

## Consent Culture

### Always Get Consent

- For play: explicit negotiation
- For touch: even a handshake, read body language
- For photos: always ask first
- For continued conversation: pay attention to signals

### Consent Violations

If you see a consent violation:
- Check in with the person affected if safe
- Report to event organizers or moderators
- Document if possible
- Believe people who report violations

### When Someone Says No

- "No" is a complete sentence
- Don't ask why
- Don't try to convince them
- Don't take it personally
- Move on gracefully

---

## Community Reputation

### Building Good Reputation

- Be consistent between online and in-person
- Follow through on what you say

- Contribute to community (volunteer, share knowledge, support events)

### Damaging Your Reputation

### Reputation Is Everything

In kink community, reputation travels. Bad behavior will follow you. Good behavior opens doors.

## FAQ

**Is it rude to not respond to messages?**
No. You're not obligated to respond to anyone. A non-response is an answer.

**Can I friend/follow someone I don't know?**
Yes, but they're not obligated to accept. Following is a lighter commitment than friending.

**Is it okay to comment on others' photos?**
If they've posted publicly and comments are enabled, yes. Keep comments respectful.

**What if I see someone I know in vanilla life?**
Pretend you didn't unless they acknowledge you first. Privacy is sacred.
