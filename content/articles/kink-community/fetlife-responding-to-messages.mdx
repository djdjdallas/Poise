Your FetLife inbox has messages. Some are promising, some are clearly not, and some are in the gray zone. How do you respond (or not respond) effectively?

Here's how to handle incoming FetLife messages with grace.

## Sorting Your Messages

### Quick Assessment

**For each message, consider:**
- Did they read my profile?
- Is there genuine effort?
- Do we have any common ground?
- What are they actually looking for?
- Do I have any interest?

### Categories of Messages

**Good messages:**
- Reference your profile specifically
- Show genuine thought
- Have clear, respectful intent
- Give you something to respond to

**Bad messages:**
- Generic copy-paste
- Immediately sexual without invitation
- Show no profile reading
- Disrespectful or entitled

**Gray zone:**
- Some effort but not great
- Not sure of their intent
- Potentially interesting but uncertain
- Worth exploring or not?

## Responding to Good Messages

### Engaging Positively

**When you're interested:**
- Respond to what they said
- Share something about yourself
- Ask follow-up questions
- Show genuine engagement

**Example response:**
> "Thanks for reaching out! I appreciated that you noticed [specific thing]. You're right that [topic] is something I've been exploring. I saw on your profile that you're interested in [their interest]—how did you get into that?"

### Setting the Tone

**Your response establishes:**
- What you're open to
- How you communicate
- The pace you prefer
- Whether this goes anywhere

### Keep Conversation Balanced

**Good conversation flow:**
- Answer their questions
- Ask questions back
- Share relevant things
- Not too short, not too long

## Responding When You're Unsure

### The Gray Zone

**When you're not sure:**
- You can ask clarifying questions
- See where conversation goes
- Give it a few exchanges
- Decide as you learn more

**Example:**
> "Thanks for the message. I'm curious what made you reach out—what about my profile interested you?"

### Gathering Information

**Questions that help you decide:**
- "What are you looking for on FetLife?"
- "What drew you to my profile?"
- "Tell me more about [thing from their profile]"

### It's Okay to Be Cautious

**You don't have to:**
- Commit to anything
- Give extensive responses to uncertain people
- Feel obligated to engage
- Make decisions immediately

## Not Responding

### When It's Okay to Ignore

**No response needed for:**
- Clearly disrespectful messages
- Generic "hey" messages
- Sexual without invitation
- People who ignored your stated preferences
- Spam or obvious copy-paste

### The Ethics of No Response

**Arguments for ignoring:**
- Your time isn't owed to strangers
- Responding to bad messages rewards bad behavior
- You receive many messages
- Self-protection is valid

**Arguments for brief response:**
- Some people genuinely don't know better
- Quick "not interested" is kind
- Closure for them

**Your choice depends on:**
- Your bandwidth
- The message quality
- Your personal values
- How many messages you receive

## Declining Politely

### When You're Not Interested

**If you want to respond but decline:**
> "Thanks for reaching out. I don't think we're a good match for what I'm looking for, but I appreciate you messaging. Good luck!"

**Brief and clear:**
> "Thanks for the message—I don't think we're compatible but I wish you well."

### Being Kind but Clear

**Key elements:**
- Acknowledge their effort (if there was any)
- Be clear about declining
- Don't leave false hope
- Wish them well

### What NOT to Say

**Avoid:**
- Being cruel or mocking
- Detailed criticism of their message
- Stringing them along
- Ghosting after extensive conversation

## Handling Problematic Messages

### Immediately Inappropriate Messages

**For clearly bad messages:**
- You can ignore
- You can block
- You can report if warranted
- Don't engage with bad behavior

### Boundary-Pushing Follow-Ups

**If someone doesn't take no:**
- Block without further engagement
- Report if they're harassing
- Don't feel obligated to explain more
- Your safety matters

### When to Block

**Block if:**
- They're disrespectful after clear communication
- They push boundaries
- You feel unsafe
- They don't accept your no

### When to Report

**Report for:**
- Harassment after clear rejection
- Threats
- Consent violations
- Behavior that violates FetLife terms

## Response Timing

### How Quickly to Respond

**No rules, but consider:**
- You don't owe instant responses
- Days-long delays can lose momentum
- Match roughly to their pace
- Respond when you have capacity

### When You're Busy

**If interested but not available:**
> "Hey! I saw your message and want to respond properly but I'm swamped this week. I'll get back to you soon!"

### Managing Volume

**If you get many messages:**
- Prioritize good ones
- It's okay to not respond to all
- Don't burn yourself out on correspondence
- Quality over quantity in responses too

## Building Good Conversations

### Following Up Well

**Keep conversations going by:**
- Asking about things they've shared
- Sharing relevant things about yourself
- Moving conversation forward naturally
- Not letting it stagnate

### Knowing Your Goals

**Be clear with yourself about:**
- What you're looking for
- What would interest you
- Where conversations should lead
- Your bandwidth for connection

### Moving Toward Meeting (Or Not)

**If conversation is going well:**
- Eventually suggest moving forward
- Video chat, event attendance, or meeting
- Don't text forever without purpose
- Have a direction in mind

## Special Situations

### Responding to Someone More Experienced

**If they're community veteran:**
- Be genuine, not sycophantic
- Engage with substance
- Don't pretend to be more experienced
- Appreciate their knowledge without pedestaling

### Responding to Newbies

**If they're newer:**
- Be kind if you engage
- Can gently correct etiquette issues
- Don't mock or belittle
- You were new once too

### Responding to Couples

**If a couple messages:**
- Make sure both are engaged
- Clarify what they're seeking
- Address both people
- Watch for red flags

## FAQ

**Do I have to respond to every message?**
No. Your time and energy aren't owed to strangers. Respond to messages worth your time.

**Is it rude not to respond?**
Not inherently. For low-effort or inappropriate messages, no response is appropriate. For thoughtful messages, a brief decline is kind but not required.

**What if they keep messaging after I don't respond?**
One follow-up might be okay. Persistent messaging after silence or decline is grounds for blocking.

**Should I explain why I'm not interested?**
Generally, no. Brief decline is sufficient. Explaining invites debate and isn't required.
