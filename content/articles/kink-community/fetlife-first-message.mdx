You've found someone interesting on FetLife. Their profile speaks to you. You want to reach out—but FetLife isn't a dating app, and the usual approaches don't work.

Here's how to craft a first message that actually gets responses.

## Understanding FetLife Culture

### FetLife Isn't Tinder

**Key differences:**
- Not primarily a dating/hookup platform
- Social network for kink community
- Cold messages often unwelcome
- Reputation matters long-term
- Context is everything

**This means:**
- Generic openers fail spectacularly
- Sexual forwards are usually inappropriate
- Building connection takes time
- Community engagement helps

### What People Receive

**Common experiences:**
- Floods of low-effort messages
- Inappropriate sexual propositions
- Copy-paste generic texts
- Messages from people who clearly didn't read profile

**Your goal:**
- Stand out from the garbage
- Show you're a real person
- Demonstrate genuine interest
- Be respectful of their time

---

## Before You Message

### Read Their Profile Thoroughly

**Look for:**
- What they're interested in
- What they explicitly say they want/don't want
- Whether they're open to messages at all
- Their relationship status and what they're seeking

**Red flags that they don't want messages:**
- "Not seeking messages from strangers"
- "Don't message me without connection first"
- "Read my whole profile before messaging"
- Closed/private relationship status

### Check Their Activity

**Consider:**
- Are they active on the platform?
- Do they engage in groups/discussions?
- Have they posted recently?
- What content do they share?

### Be Honest with Yourself

**Ask:**
- Why am I reaching out?
- What do I actually want?
- Do I have anything genuine to offer?
- Is this appropriate given their profile?

## Crafting Your Message

### The Essential Elements

**A good first message:**
1. Shows you read their profile
2. Has a specific reason for reaching out
3. Gives them something to respond to
4. Respects their time and autonomy
5. Isn't sexual (unless clearly invited)

### What to Include

**Start with:**
- Reference to something specific in their profile
- Why you're reaching out
- Brief relevant context about yourself
- A question or conversation starter

**Keep it:**
- Concise (a few short paragraphs max)
- Focused on shared interest or genuine curiosity
- Warm but not presumptuous
- Free of expectations

### Example Messages

**Connecting over shared interest:**
> "Hi! I saw your writing about rope bondage safety—really appreciated your point about nerve checks. I've been learning shibari for about a year and am always looking for people who take safety seriously. Would love to connect if you're open to chatting about techniques."

**Reaching out after group interaction:**
> "Hey, I've seen your thoughtful comments in the [Group Name] discussions and wanted to say I really appreciate your perspective. Your take on [topic] especially resonated. Would love to connect here if that's welcome."

**Genuine curiosity:**
> "I came across your profile through [mutual group/interest] and was intrigued by your approach to [specific thing]. I'm newer to exploring that area and always appreciate learning from people who've thought deeply about it. Open to questions if you're ever interested in chatting."

### What NOT to Write

**Avoid:**
- "Hey" / "Hi" / "Hello" (alone)
- "Nice pics"
- Anything sexual without clear invitation
- Your entire life story
- Demands for attention or response
- Negging or manipulation
- Copy-paste messages

**Terrible messages:**
> "Hey gorgeous, love your pics. Want to chat?" ❌

> "I'm a dom looking for a sub. You look like you'd be fun to train." ❌

> "I noticed you like bondage. Me too. We should meet up." ❌

## When NOT to Message

### Clear Signals

**Don't message if:**
- Profile says "don't message me"
- They're not seeking what you want
- No common ground exists
- Your interest is purely sexual and theirs isn't
- You'd just be adding to their noise

### Inappropriate Contexts

**Bad times to cold message:**
- Someone clearly in closed relationship
- Someone who only engages in groups
- Someone who's explicitly not seeking connections
- Someone way outside your experience level (without humility)

### When to Engage Differently

**Better approaches than messaging:**
- Comment thoughtfully on their public posts
- Interact in shared groups first
- Attend same events
- Build organic connection

---

## Special Situations

### Messaging Experienced/Prominent People

**They receive many messages, so:**
- Be extra respectful of their time
- Have specific reason for reaching out
- Don't expect quick response
- Be okay with no response

**Approach with humility:**
> "I know you probably get lots of messages, so I'll keep this brief. I've learned a lot from your writings on [topic] and wanted to thank you for sharing your knowledge. If you're ever open to connecting, I'd love that—but no pressure either way."

### Messaging About Play

**If your interest is specifically play-related:**
- Still don't open with play requests
- Build connection first
- Mention your interest contextually
- Let it develop naturally

**The journey:**
1. Initial connection message
2. Conversation develops
3. Mutual interest established
4. Play discussion happens organically

### Messaging Couples

**If they have a joint profile:**
- Address both people
- Be clear about what you're seeking
- Don't try to separate them
- Respect their structure

## After You Send

### Managing Expectations

**Understand:**
- Many people don't respond
- No response isn't personal
- Busy people may take time
- Some aren't checking messages

### If They Respond

**Keep momentum by:**
- Responding thoughtfully
- Continuing the conversation naturally
- Not jumping to meeting/play immediately
- Building actual connection

### If They Don't Respond

**Don't:**
- Send follow-up demanding response
- Get angry or resentful
- Badmouth them
- Take it personally

**Do:**
- Accept it gracefully
- Move on
- Consider if your message could improve
- Find other connections

## Building Messaging Success

### Improve Your Profile First

**Better profile = better responses:**
- Complete, thoughtful profile
- Clear about who you are
- Shows community engagement
- Not just "looking for..."

### Engage in Community

**Organic connections work better:**
- Participate in groups
- Comment on discussions
- Attend events
- Build reputation

### Quality Over Quantity

**Instead of mass-messaging:**
- Be selective
- Send fewer, better messages
- Focus on genuine connections
- Build relationships over time

## FAQ

**How long should my first message be?**
A few short paragraphs. Long enough to show genuine thought, short enough to respect their time. Under 200 words is usually good.

**Should I mention my kinks in the first message?**
Only if directly relevant to why you're connecting. Don't lead with sexual content unless they've explicitly invited that.

**What if they have a very short profile?**
Harder to craft a good message. Consider whether there's enough to connect over, or engage with them in groups first.

**Is it okay to message someone just because I find them attractive?**
On FetLife, usually not well-received. Find something genuine to connect over, or accept that cold-approaching based on attraction alone often fails here.
