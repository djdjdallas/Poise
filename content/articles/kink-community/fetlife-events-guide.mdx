FetLife isn't a dating app—it's a social network. And the best way to meet people on any social network is through shared activities. FetLife's events feature connects you to munches, workshops, parties, and everything in between.

Here's how to actually use it.

## Evaluating Events

### Before Attending, Check:

**The organizer:**
- How long have they been on FetLife?
- Are they active in the community?
- What do others say about their events?

**The attendees:**
- Who's marked "going"?
- Are there people you know or recognize?
- What's the gender/experience mix?

**The description:**
- Is it clear about what to expect?
- Are rules and expectations stated?
- Does it seem well-organized?

**The venue:**
- Is it appropriate for the event type?
- Is it accessible to you?
- Does the location make sense?

### Red Flags

- Vague descriptions
- Play parties with no stated rules
- Events requiring excessive personal info upfront
- Reviews mentioning boundary violations

## Preparing for Your First Event

### Mental Preparation

**Set realistic expectations:**
- You might not meet your perfect partner
- It might be awkward at first
- It takes time to feel comfortable
- Most people are friendly but busy with their own friends

**Manage anxiety:**
- It's normal to be nervous
- Remember, others have been new too
- You don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with
- You can leave anytime

### Practical Preparation

**For munches:**
- Know the venue address and parking
- Bring cash (some venues are cash-only)
- Have the organizer's contact info
- Arrive slightly early or on time

**For parties/play events:**
- Understand the dress code
- Know the rules before arrival
- Bring any supplies you might need
- Have a safe call arranged

### What to Bring

**To munches:**
- Just yourself
- Maybe business cards (some people have FetLife cards)
- Cash for your own food/drinks

**To play parties:**
- Your own toys (if you plan to play)
- Safer sex supplies
- Change of clothes
- Water
- Any required items per dress code

## At the Event

### Arriving

**For munches:**
- Look for the group (they often have a sign or symbol)
- Approach and introduce yourself: "Hi, I'm [name]. This is my first munch here."
- Most munches are welcoming to newcomers

**For parties:**
- Check in at the door
- Get oriented (rules, layout, where things are)
- Start by observing before engaging

### Socializing

**Conversation starters:**
> "Hi, I'm new here. How did you find out about this group?"
> "Is this your first time at this event?"
> "How long have you been part of this community?"

**Things to avoid:**
- Asking about people's kinks immediately
- Intense personal questions to strangers
- Assuming everyone wants to play or date you
- Ignoring social cues

### At Play Events

**If you're new:**
- Observing is completely valid
- Don't interrupt scenes
- Ask permission before touching anyone or anything
- Follow all stated rules

**If you want to play:**
- Negotiate beforehand, not in the moment
- Make sure you know the space's rules
- Have your boundaries clear
- Don't assume anything

## After the Event

### Following Up

**With the organizer:**
> "Thanks for hosting! I had a great time."

**With people you met:**
> "Hey, we met at [event] last night. I enjoyed our conversation about [topic]. Would love to chat more sometime."

### Building Relationships

One event rarely creates deep connections. Consistent attendance over time:
- Makes your face familiar
- Builds trust and reputation
- Creates opportunities for connection
- Establishes you as part of the community

### Processing the Experience

**Ask yourself:**
- Did I feel comfortable? Why or why not?
- Did I meet anyone I want to get to know better?
- Would I go to this type of event again?
- What would I do differently?

## Common Concerns

### "What If I Don't Know Anyone?"

Everyone starts not knowing anyone. Options:
- Introduce yourself to the organizer
- Join conversations at common areas
- Look for other people alone
- Ask someone to introduce you around

### "What If People Are Weird?"

Some might be, by mainstream standards. But "weird" often just means "different from what you're used to." Give people a chance.

### "What If I See Someone I Know?"

They're there for the same reasons you are. Mutual discretion is standard. A nod of acknowledgment and carrying on is normal.

### "What If I'm Asked to Do Something I Don't Want?"

Say no. A simple "No, thank you" is sufficient. Anyone who pushes past that is violating consent norms, and you can report them to organizers.

### "What If I Feel Overwhelmed?"

It's okay to leave. Step outside, take a break, or go home. Your comfort matters.
