## Pre-Scene: The Setup

### Negotiation

**Before anything else:**

- What are soft limits?
- What's the goal/mood?

**Cover:**

## Scene Structure

### The Arc

**Most scenes follow:**
1. Warmup/buildup
2. Escalation
3. Peak intensity
4. Descent
5. Conclusion/transition to aftercare

### Warmup/Buildup

**Beginning phase:**

- Allow bodies and minds to adjust

### Escalation

**Building intensity:**
- Gradually increase
- Watch responses carefully
- Check in as needed
- Build toward intended peak

### Peak

**Maximum intensity:**
- Highest point of the scene
- Where you've been building to
- Hold appropriately
- Read when to begin descent

### Descent and Ending

**Coming down:**
- Gradual reduction
- Don't stop abruptly (usually)
- Transition smoothly
- Signal the scene is ending

## Building Energy

### Pacing

**Control the rhythm:**

- Slow pace builds tension

- Don't rush every moment
- Let tension build

### Variety

**Mix it up:**
- Different sensations

- Different intensities
- Maintain engagement

### Connection

**Stay connected:**

## FAQ

**How long should a scene be?**
Varies enormously. Some scenes are 20 minutes, some are hours. Base it on activities, stamina, and mutual desire.

**What if the scene doesn't go as planned?**
Scenes rarely go exactly as planned. Be flexible, read the moment, and adjust. The goal is mutual enjoyment, not plan execution.

**How do I get better at running scenes?**
Experience, education, feedback, and reflection. Ask partners what worked. Take classes. Learn from each scene.

**What if I can't get into the right headspace?**
It's okay to postpone. Better to reschedule than have a bad scene because you weren't present.
