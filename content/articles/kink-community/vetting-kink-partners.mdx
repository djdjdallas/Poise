In kink, you're often putting yourself in vulnerable positions with someone. That requires trust—and trust should be earned, not assumed. Vetting is how you assess whether someone deserves that trust.

Here's how to vet kink partners effectively.

---

## Why Vetting Matters

### The Stakes Are Higher

**In kink you might be:**
- Physically restrained
- In vulnerable positions
- Sharing deep secrets
- Testing physical limits
- Depending on someone's skill

### Trust Must Be Earned

**You need to know:**
- Are they who they say they are?
- Do they have the skills they claim?
- Will they respect your limits?
- What does the community say about them?

---

## Starting the Vetting Process

### Online First

**Before meeting:**
- Talk extensively online
- Video chat if possible
- Ask questions and observe answers
- Look for consistency

### Initial Questions

**Learn about:**
- Their experience level (specifics, not vague claims)
- How they learned (mentors, community, self-taught)
- Their approach to safety
- Past relationships and why they ended

### Verify Claims

**Look for:**
- Consistency in their story
- Community connections you can check
- Evidence of stated experience
- Red flags in how they talk

---

## Community Verification

### Ask Around

**If they're in the community:**
- Do people know them?
- What's their reputation?
- Any warnings or concerns?
- How do they treat others at events?

### Check References

**You can:**
- Ask for references from past partners
- Contact people they've played with
- Ask organizers about them
- Verify workshop attendance claims

### Limitations

**Remember:**
- Not everyone is in the community
- New doesn't mean dangerous
- Reputation isn't everything
- Do your own assessment too

---

## What to Look For

### Green Flags

**Positive signs:**
- Asks about your limits and respects them
- Talks about safety unprompted
- Has verifiable community involvement
- Takes no for an answer gracefully
- Discusses aftercare naturally

### Yellow Flags

**Proceed with caution:**
- Vague about experience
- No community connections
- Pushes for quick escalation
- Dismissive of concerns
- Inconsistent stories

### Red Flags

**Stop and reconsider:**
- Doesn't want to discuss limits
- Pressures you past comfort
- Bad reputation in community
- Claims too much experience
- Others warn you about them

---

## Specific Questions to Ask

### About Experience

**Get specifics:**
- "What activities have you done?"
- "How long have you practiced?"
- "Who taught you?"
- "What mistakes have you made and learned from?"

### About Safety

**Test their knowledge:**
- "What safety measures do you use for [activity]?"
- "What's your aftercare approach?"
- "What would you do if something went wrong?"
- "How do you handle safewords?"

### About Past Partners

**Learn from history:**
- "Why did past play relationships end?"
- "What have partners taught you?"
- "Can you tell me about a time you stopped a scene?"
- "What feedback have you received?"

---

## The Public Meeting

### First Meeting Strategy

**Do:**
- Meet in public first
- Don't play on first meeting
- Have your own transportation
- Tell someone where you are

### What to Observe

**Watch for:**
- How they treat servers/staff
- Do they respect your boundaries?
- Are they consistent with online persona?
- How do they handle disagreement?

### Trust Your Gut

**If something feels off:**
- Take it seriously
- You don't need to justify
- It's okay to end the meeting
- Better safe than sorry

---

## Gradual Trust Building

### Start Small

**Before intense play:**
- Meet multiple times
- Do low-risk activities first
- Build up gradually
- Earn trust incrementally

### Test Smaller Boundaries

**Observe:**
- Do they respect small limits?
- How do they handle "no" to minor things?
- Are they patient with your pace?
- Do they push or respect?

### Communication Style

**Notice:**
- Do they check in?
- How do they handle feedback?
- Can they discuss difficult topics?
- Do they communicate clearly?

---

## Vetting for Specific Dynamics

### For Submissives Vetting Dominants

**Extra scrutiny on:**
- How do they use power?
- References from past subs
- Track record with consent
- How do they handle conflict?

### For Dominants Vetting Submissives

**Pay attention to:**
- Can they safeword?
- Do they communicate limits clearly?
- Are they honest about experience?
- Do they have realistic expectations?

### For Switches

**Consider both directions:**
- Vet for both roles
- Different concerns for each
- Clarify which dynamic when
- Assess compatibility both ways

---

## Long-Distance Vetting

### Extra Challenges

**When you can't meet easily:**
- More video calls
- Longer online vetting period
- Check references more thoroughly
- Plan public first meeting carefully

### Before Traveling to Meet

**Ensure:**
- Extensive online relationship first
- Community verification if possible
- Safety plan in place
- Accommodation independent of them

---

## Ongoing Vetting

### Early Play Period

**Continue assessing:**
- How do they handle scenes?
- Do they respect safewords?
- Is aftercare consistent?
- Do they match their claims?

### Relationship Changes

**Re-vet when:**
- Increasing intensity
- New activities introduced
- Dynamic shifts
- Concerns arise

---

## When to Walk Away

### Clear Dealbreakers

**Exit if:**
- They violated a limit
- Community warns you repeatedly
- They dismiss safety concerns
- Your gut says no
- They pressure you to skip vetting

### It's Always Okay

**Remember:**
- You owe them nothing
- Safety comes first
- Trust your assessment
- Walking away is valid

## FAQ

**How long should vetting take?**
There's no set timeline. It depends on the intensity of what you want to do and how quickly trust develops. Weeks to months is common.

**What if they're new to the community?**
New doesn't mean unsafe, but proceed more slowly. Extra communication, lower intensity starting point, more gradual building.

**Can I vet too much?**
You can get stuck in analysis paralysis. At some point you have information and make a decision. But err on the side of more vetting.

**What if someone won't answer questions?**
That's information. Reluctance to discuss experience, safety, or history is a red flag.
