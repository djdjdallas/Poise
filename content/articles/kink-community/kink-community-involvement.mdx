## FAQ

**I'm nervous about going to my first event. Is that normal?**
Completely. Everyone was nervous their first time. Munches are specifically designed to be low-key and welcoming to newcomers.

**What if people recognize me?**
They're there for the same reason. Community norm is "what happens at kink events stays there." Everyone protects each other.

**Do I need a partner to get involved?**
No. Many people come to community single. You'll meet potential partners there, or simply learn and grow alone.

**How long before I can go to a play party?**
Varies by community and your progress. Some require specific vetting, others are more open. Ask community members about the path.
