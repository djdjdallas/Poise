FetLife may not act on all reports, especially in ambiguous situations. You've done what you can. Consider community channels if appropriate.

**Can I report something that happened offline?**
Yes, if the person is on FetLife. Especially if there's a pattern or ongoing risk. FetLife cares about community safety broadly.

**What if I'm falsely reported?**
FetLife will review the situation. If you didn't violate terms, you should be fine. Consider whether there's a conflict that needs addressing.
