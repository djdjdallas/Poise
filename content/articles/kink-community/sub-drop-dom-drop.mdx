The scene was intense. Maybe amazing. You felt high, connected, alive. Then—hours or days later—you crash. You feel sad, anxious, weepy, disconnected, or just wrong. What happened?

You're experiencing drop. It's a real phenomenon that affects both bottoms (sub drop) and tops (dom drop/top drop). Here's what it is and how to handle it.

---

## What Is Drop?

### The Basic Explanation

During intense scenes, your body releases a cocktail of chemicals:
- Endorphins (natural painkillers, euphoria)
- Adrenaline (energy, alertness)
- Dopamine (pleasure, reward)
- Oxytocin (bonding, connection)

This creates the "high" of a good scene—sometimes called "subspace" for bottoms.

After the scene, these chemicals crash back to normal levels. The drop in these chemicals creates physical and emotional symptoms—what we call "drop."

### Why It Happens

Drop is essentially a chemical hangover. Your body used up its feel-good chemicals and needs time to replenish them.

Additional factors:
- Physical exhaustion from the scene
- Emotional processing
- Transition from intense connection to separation
- Return to "regular life" after heightened experience

### When It Happens

Drop can occur:
- Immediately after the scene
- Hours later (often the next morning)
- Days later (delayed drop)
- After leaving your partner's presence
- When returning to mundane responsibilities

The timing varies by person and scene intensity.

## Sub Drop

### What Sub Drop Feels Like

**Physical symptoms:**
- Fatigue and exhaustion
- Flu-like symptoms
- Headaches
- Muscle aches
- Shaking or chills
- Appetite changes

**Emotional symptoms:**
- Sadness or depression
- Anxiety
- Weepiness
- Feeling "off" or disconnected
- Neediness or clinginess
- Irritability
- Feeling unloved or abandoned
- Questioning the relationship or dynamic

**Cognitive symptoms:**
- Difficulty concentrating
- Feeling "foggy"
- Negative self-talk
- Ruminating on aspects of the scene

### Why It's Often Worse for Bottoms

Bottoms frequently experience more intense drop because:
- Their bodies produced more endorphins (from pain or intensity)
- Subspace takes them further from baseline
- The vulnerability of the role adds emotional dimension
- Coming back from surrender takes processing

### Managing Sub Drop

**Prevention:**
- Good aftercare immediately post-scene
- Staying hydrated and fed
- Planning for rest after intense scenes
- Keeping contact with your partner when possible

**When it hits:**
- Recognize it: "This is drop, not reality"
- Self-care: Rest, comfort food, warm blankets
- Connection: Reach out to your partner or support people
- Grounding: Remind yourself this will pass
- Gentleness: Don't expect productivity or normal functioning

**Communication:**
Tell your partner you're experiencing drop. Good partners want to support you through it.

> "Hey, I'm hitting some drop from our scene. I'm feeling really sad and disconnected. I could use some reassurance/a check-in/just knowing you're thinking of me."

## Dom Drop / Top Drop

### What Dom Drop Feels Like

**Physical symptoms:**
- Exhaustion
- Feeling physically drained
- Sleep disruption
- Appetite changes

**Emotional symptoms:**
- Guilt about what you did to your partner
- Worry that you hurt them or went too far
- Feeling like a bad person
- Sadness or depression
- Disconnection
- Questioning your desires

**Cognitive symptoms:**
- Ruminating on scenes
- Second-guessing decisions
- Negative self-perception
- Difficulty with normal tasks

### Why Tops Experience Drop

Dom drop is often overlooked, but it's real and common:

**Physical causes:**
- Adrenaline crash
- Energy expenditure during the scene
- Focus and attention drain

**Emotional causes:**
- Responsibility weight
- Processing having inflicted pain/control on someone you care about
- Coming down from the power high
- Returning to egalitarian relating after dominance

**The guilt factor:**
Many tops experience specific guilt about enjoying causing pain or exercising control. This can feel confusing and shameful, contributing to drop.

### Managing Dom Drop

**Prevention:**
- Aftercare for tops (yes, you deserve it too)
- Positive feedback from partners
- Self-compassion about your desires
- Planning for rest after scenes

**When it hits:**
- Recognize it: "This is drop, not reality"
- Seek reassurance: Ask your partner how they're feeling about the scene
- Self-care: Rest, comfort, activities you enjoy
- Connection: Talk to community or partners who understand
- Perspective: Remember that consensual kink is ethical

**Communication:**
Tell your partner you're experiencing drop. You're allowed to need support too.

> "I'm having some dom drop. I'm feeling guilty about last night even though I know you wanted it. Could you tell me it was good for you?"

## Drop in Different Contexts

### After Intense vs. Light Scenes

More intense scenes generally produce more intense drop:
- Heavy pain play → more endorphin crash
- Deep power exchange → more emotional processing
- Long scenes → more physical depletion

But light scenes can also cause drop, especially when emotionally significant.

### After Playing with New Partners

Drop can be more intense with new partners:
- Less established aftercare routines
- Uncertainty about checking in
- Less baseline security to return to
- More to process about the new experience

### Long-Distance or Separation

When partners separate after scenes:
- Drop often hits harder
- Connection can't be maintained in person
- Phone/video check-ins become important
- Planning for distance is essential

### Planned vs. Unexpected

Drop you expect and plan for is easier to manage than surprise drop days later.

## Aftercare That Prevents (or Lessens) Drop

### Immediate Aftercare

**Physical:**
- Warmth (blankets, body heat)
- Hydration
- Food (especially sugar for blood glucose)
- Physical closeness
- Gentle touch

**Emotional:**
- Presence and attention
- Words of affirmation
- Reassurance
- Checking in

### Extended Aftercare

**Hours later:**
- Check-in texts or calls
- Continued availability
- Processing conversation if wanted

**Days later:**
- Follow-up on how they're feeling
- Acknowledgment that drop might occur
- Continued connection

### Self-Aftercare

**For when partner isn't available:**
- Comfort items (soft things, weighted blankets)
- Self-soothing activities
- Connection with friends or support network
- Rest and gentleness

## When Drop Becomes Concerning

### Normal Drop vs. Something More

**Normal drop:**
- Resolves within hours to a few days
- Recognizable as drop
- Responds to care and time
- Doesn't significantly impair functioning

**Concerning signs:**
- Lasts more than a few days with no improvement
- Severe depression or anxiety
- Thoughts of self-harm
- Complete inability to function
- Drop after every scene regardless of intensity

### When to Seek Help

Consider professional support if:
- Drop is consistently severe
- It's affecting your ability to engage with life
- It's making you want to stop kink entirely
- Underlying mental health conditions might be involved

A kink-aware therapist can help distinguish between drop and other issues.

## FAQ

**Can you have drop without having a great scene?**
Yes. Drop is chemical, not just emotional. Even mediocre or difficult scenes can cause drop.

**Is drop inevitable?**
Not always. Some scenes don't cause significant drop. Some people rarely experience it. But it's common enough that planning for it is wise.

**Can you drop from vanilla sex?**
Yes, though it's usually less intense. Any intense physical or emotional experience can cause a version of drop.

**What if my partner doesn't believe drop is real?**
This is a red flag. Drop is well-documented in the kink community. A partner who dismisses it may not provide adequate aftercare.
