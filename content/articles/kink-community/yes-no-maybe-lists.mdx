## What Is a Yes/No/Maybe List

### The Basic Concept

**A list of kink activities where you mark each as:**
- **Yes:** Things you want to do/are interested in
- **No:** Things you don't want to do (hard limits)
- **Maybe:** Things you're curious about, might try under right circumstances, or need to know more about

### Why They're Useful

**Lists help you:**
- Identify your interests and limits
- Communicate clearly with partners
- Compare compatibility
- Start negotiation conversations
- Discover things you hadn't considered

## How to Fill Out Your List

### First Time Through

**Approach it by:**
- Going through each item
- Initial gut reaction
- Not overthinking
- Being honest with yourself

### Categories Beyond Yes/No/Maybe

**Some people add:**
- **Give vs. receive** (for applicable activities)
- **Experience level** (done vs. want to try)
- **Interest level** (1-5 scale)
- **Notes** (conditions, specifics)

### Take Your Time

**Don't rush:**
- It can be a lot to process
- Come back to uncertain items
- Research things you don't know
- Let it evolve over time

## Tips for Effective Lists

### Be Specific

**Instead of:** "Bondage - Yes"
**Better:** "Rope on arms - Yes, Suspension - No, Restraints - Maybe"

### Note Conditions

**Example:**
- "Impact play - Yes (avoid kidneys)"
- "Wax - Maybe (need to test for sensitivity)"
- "Blindfolds - Yes (with established partners only)"

### Distinguish Give vs. Receive

**For many activities:**
- Interest in doing to someone
- Interest in having done to you
- Can be completely different
- Note both where applicable

### Rate Your Interest

**Beyond just yes:**
- How interested?
- Priority level?
- Would seek out vs. would try?
- Helps partners understand enthusiasm level

## Common Mistakes

### Not Being Honest

**Problem:** Marking things as yes to seem open-minded
**Better:** Honest answers protect you and inform partners

### Leaving Too Many Maybes

**Problem:** Everything is "maybe" = no useful information
**Better:** Push yourself to decide, note conditions on maybes

### Not Updating

**Problem:** Using an outdated list
**Better:** Review and update regularly

### Treating It as Complete Negotiation

**Problem:** "We exchanged lists, negotiation done"
**Better:** Lists start conversation, not replace it

---

## For Different Relationship Types

## FAQ

**How long does it take to fill out?**
First time might be an hour or more for comprehensive lists. Updates are quicker. Take the time you need.

**What if I don't know what something is?**
Research it, or mark "need more information." Better to learn than guess.

**What if I change my mind after marking something?**
Lists can change. Nothing is permanent. Just communicate changes to partners.

**Should I share my full list with everyone?**
Up to you. Some share fully, others share what's relevant to potential play. Decide your comfort level.
