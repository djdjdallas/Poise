Knowing when to message on FetLife is important. Knowing when NOT to message might be even more important. Sending the wrong message at the wrong time can damage your reputation and make you part of the problem many people experience on the platform.

Here's when to hold off.

## When Their Profile Says So

### Explicit "Don't Message" Statements

**Respect if they say:**
- "Not seeking messages from strangers"
- "Don't message me without connecting first"
- "I don't respond to cold messages"
- "Only message if we've met in person"

**These are boundaries. Honor them.**

### What They're NOT Seeking

**If their profile says they're not seeking:**
- Play partners (and that's what you want)
- New connections
- Messages from [your category]
- What you're offering

**Don't message anyway hoping to be the exception.**

### Relationship Status Indicators

**Think twice if they're:**
- In a closed relationship
- Clearly not available
- Not seeking outside connections
- Monogamous

---

## When You Have Nothing to Say

### The "Hey" Problem

**Don't message just to say:**
- "Hey"
- "Hi"
- "How are you?"
- "What's up?"

**These messages:**
- Show zero effort
- Give nothing to respond to
- Will likely be ignored
- Make you part of the noise

### No Common Ground

**Don't message if:**
- You have nothing specific to connect over
- You haven't read their profile
- You don't know why you're reaching out
- Your only reason is attraction

### Nothing Genuine to Offer

**Ask yourself:**
- What would I actually talk about?
- What do I bring to this interaction?
- Is there a real reason to connect?
- Would I want this message if I received it?

---

## When Your Intent Is Problematic

### Purely Sexual Cold Outreach

**Don't message to:**
- Proposition them for sex/play
- Send explicit content unsolicited
- Describe what you want to do to them
- Treat them as a fantasy fulfillment

**Unless their profile explicitly invites this, it's inappropriate.**

### When You Just Want Something From Them

**Don't message if you only want:**
- Free mentorship
- Play with an "experienced" person
- Someone to fulfill your fantasy
- Association with their status

### Entitlement

**Check yourself if you're thinking:**
- "They should feel lucky I'm messaging them"
- "I deserve a response"
- "They put themselves out there, so they should expect messages"
- "I'm different from the others they reject"

---

## When Timing Is Wrong

### Right After a Breakup Post

**If someone just posted about:**
- Relationship ending
- Difficult situation
- Emotional struggle

**Don't:**
- Swoop in as a "rebound"
- Use their vulnerability to connect
- Offer yourself as comfort romantically/sexually

### During or After Conflict

**If they're:**
- Involved in community drama
- Dealing with difficult situation
- Processing something publicly

**Not the time to cold message.**

### When They're Clearly Overwhelmed

**If their profile/posts indicate:**
- Too many messages
- Taking a break
- Overwhelmed with attention
- Stepping back

**Respect that.**

---

## When You're Not Ready

### Profile Isn't Complete

**Don't message if you have:**
- No profile picture (or just body parts)
- Empty or minimal profile
- No community engagement
- "Just checking this out"

**Build your own presence first.**

### You Haven't Engaged in Community

**Better to first:**
- Participate in groups
- Attend events
- Build some reputation
- Have something to show

### You Don't Know What You Want

**If you're:**
- Unsure what you're seeking
- Just browsing without purpose
- Not ready to actually connect
- Testing the waters

**Work on that first.**

---

## When It Would Be Disrespectful

### Crossing Power Dynamics Inappropriately

**Be careful about:**
- Messaging someone way out of your experience level with play requests
- Approaching educators expecting free teaching
- Messaging community leaders for personal access
- Using their position as your reason

### Not Reading the Room

**Consider:**
- Are they approachable via messages?
- Have they indicated how they want to be contacted?
- Is messaging the appropriate way to reach them?
- Would they welcome your contact?

### Ignoring Evident Preferences

**If their profile shows:**
- Clear preferences you don't match
- Things they're not interested in (that's you)
- Who they do/don't want to hear from

**Don't think you're the exception.**

---

## Alternatives to Messaging

### Engage Publicly First

**Instead of cold messaging:**
- Comment on their posts
- Participate in same groups
- Attend same events
- Let them become aware of you

### Build Organic Connection

**Connections often work better when:**
- They develop naturally
- Based on shared context
- Not random cold outreach
- Built over time

### Wait for Better Timing

**Sometimes:**
- Better to wait
- For opportunity to present itself
- For genuine reason to connect
- For mutual context to exist

## Red Flags You're About to Make a Mistake

### Check Yourself If You're...

**Rationalizing:**
- "They probably won't mind"
- "I'm different from other messagers"
- "The worst they can say is no"
- "I have to shoot my shot"

**Feeling entitled:**
- "I deserve a response"
- "They put themselves out there"
- "Their profile is an invitation"
- "They should be flattered"

**Ignoring signals:**
- "Maybe they don't really mean 'no messages'"
- "That boundary doesn't apply to me"
- "I can change their mind"
- "They'll see I'm worth responding to"

---

## The Bigger Picture

- Respects everyone's boundaries

## FAQ

**What if I really want to connect but all these rules apply?**
Find another way—public engagement, events, organic connection. If you can't connect appropriately, maybe the connection shouldn't happen.

**What if they don't explicitly say not to message?**
Use judgment. Not having a "no messages" statement doesn't mean all messages are welcome.

**What if I just want to compliment them?**
Compliments can still be unwelcome from strangers. Ask yourself if your compliment is genuinely valuable to them or just something you want to say.

**But how do I ever meet anyone if I can't message?**
Engage in community. Attend events. Participate in groups. Let connections develop naturally. FetLife isn't primarily a dating platform.
