## Before You Delete

### Consider Your Options

**Deletion isn't the only choice:**
- **Deactivation:** Hide your profile temporarily
- **Privacy lockdown:** Restrict access while keeping account
- **Clean-up:** Remove content but keep the account
- **Full deletion:** Permanent account removal

### What You'll Lose

**Deletion removes:**
- Your profile and all content
- Friend connections
- Group memberships
- Event RSVPs
- Messages (your copy)
- Writings and photos
- Your username (someone else can claim it)

### What Remains

**Even after deletion:**
- Others' copies of your messages
- Screenshots others may have taken
- Cached pages (temporary)
- Others' memories of interactions

## Preparing for Deletion

### Download Your Data

**Before deleting, save:**
- Any writings you want to keep (copy/paste)
- Photos you uploaded (download originals)
- Important message threads (screenshot or copy)
- List of friends/connections you want to maintain elsewhere

### Inform Key Connections

**Let important people know:**

- Give alternative contact info
- Partners or regular connections
- Anyone expecting to hear from you

### Check Group Roles

**If you're a group admin:**
- Transfer ownership to someone else
- Or close the group intentionally
- Don't leave groups without leadership unexpectedly

### Review Privacy First

**Before deletion:**
- Remove identifying photos
- Clear bio of identifying info
- Delete sensitive writings
- Unfriend/unfollow if relevant

## Deactivation vs. Deletion

### Deactivation (Temporary)

**What it does:**

- Preserves all your data
- Can be reactivated anytime

**How to deactivate:**
1. Go to Settings
2. Find "Deactivate Account"
3. Confirm deactivation
4. Your profile becomes invisible

**To reactivate:**
- Simply log in again
- Everything is restored

### Deletion (Permanent)

**What it does:**
- Permanently removes your account
- Cannot be undone
- Data is deleted (with some lag)
- You can't get it back

**When to choose deletion:**
- You're certain you won't return
- You want complete removal
- Privacy concerns require it
- You want a fresh start with new identity

## Privacy Concerns

### Photos You've Shared

**Consider:**
- Others may have saved your photos
- Downloaded photos persist even after deletion
- Be aware of what you've shared and with whom
- Nothing on the internet is truly deletable

### Messages to Others

**What to know:**
- Your copy of messages is deleted
- Recipients still have their copies
- You can't delete from their inboxes
- Consider what sensitive info you've shared

### Cached and Archived Content

**Potential persistence:**
- Web caches may temporarily retain content
- Some archive services may have captures
- Search engines don't index FetLife (good)
- But nothing is guaranteed invisible

---

## Alternative Options

### Profile Lockdown

**Instead of deleting:**
1. Remove all photos
2. Clear your bio
3. Remove fetish list
4. Set everything to private
5. Keep account minimal

**Why do this:**
- Preserves your username
- Keeps friend connections for future
- You can return without starting over
- Still mostly invisible

### Fresh Start (New Account)

**If the issue is your history:**
- Delete current account
- Create new account with different username
- Start fresh with better approach
- Note: FetLife doesn't encourage multiple accounts

### Taking a Break

**Deactivation is good for:**
- Mental health breaks
- Relationship changes
- Needing space from community
- Uncertainty about long-term

## Reasons People Leave

### Healthy Reasons

**Legitimate departures:**
- No longer interested in kink community
- Privacy concerns

### Consider First

**Before leaving, ask:**
- Is this about FetLife, or about something else?
- Would a break accomplish the same goal?
- Are there specific issues that could be addressed?
- Will I regret losing my connections?

### Unhealthy Reasons

**You might reconsider if:**
- Leaving because of one bad interaction

## After Deletion

### Community Continuity

- Exchange contact info before deleting
- Join alternative platforms
- Stay connected through other means
- Attend events even without online presence

### If You Return

**Coming back after deletion:**

## Protecting Your Privacy Long-Term

### Before You Ever Need to Leave

**Best practices:**
- Never share photos you can't accept being out
- Use separate email for kink accounts
- Don't cross-reference with vanilla identity
- Think before posting

### Ongoing Privacy Hygiene

**Regular maintenance:**

- Delete old content that's no longer relevant
- Update privacy settings as platform changes
- Audit who has your information

## FAQ

**Can I delete my account and come back with the same username?**
Not guaranteed. Once released, usernames can be claimed by others.

**Will people know I deleted?**
Your profile will simply be gone. People who try to access it will see it doesn't exist. Close friends will notice.

**Can FetLife recover my data if I change my mind?**
After full deletion, likely not. Act only when you're sure.

**What if someone is impersonating me after I leave?**
Report to FetLife even without an account. Document and contact support.
