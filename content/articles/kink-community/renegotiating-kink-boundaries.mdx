## When to Renegotiate

### Scheduled Reviews

**Plan regular check-ins:**
- Monthly or quarterly reviews
- Anniversary of dynamic
- After significant experiences
- Periodic relationship discussions

### After Experiences

**Renegotiate when:**
- You've tried something new
- Something didn't work as expected
- You had a reaction to an activity
- Experience taught you something

### When Feelings Change

**Listen to yourself:**
- Something that was yes becomes uncertain
- Something that was no becomes curious
- Enthusiasm for activities shifts
- Emotional landscape changes

### When Asked

**If partner initiates:**
- Be open to discussion
- Don't be defensive
- Their needs matter too
- Regular dialogue is healthy

## How to Bring It Up

### Frame Positively

**Approach it as:**
- Relationship maintenance
- Growth and evolution
- Staying in alignment
- Caring about the dynamic

### Be Direct

**Simply say:**
- "I'd like to revisit our agreements"
- "Some of my limits have changed"
- "Can we talk about how our dynamic is going?"
- "I have some new interests to discuss"

### Choose Good Timing

**Not:**
- Mid-scene
- During conflict
- When distracted or rushed
- When intoxicated

**Instead:**
- Dedicated time
- Both present and calm
- Enough time to discuss fully

## Expanding Boundaries

### When You Want to Try More

**If soft limits are softening:**
- Express your interest
- Discuss what changed
- Talk about conditions
- Move slowly

### Approaching It Safely

**For new territory:**
- Start with lighter versions
- Build up gradually
- Check in frequently
- Permission to step back

### Partner Response

**Your partner might:**
- Be excited too
- Need time to consider
- Have different interest level
- Have concerns to address

**All responses are valid.**

## Tightening Boundaries

### When You Need to Pull Back

**Sometimes you need:**
- More limits than before
- To stop doing something
- Less intensity
- Different approach

### Reasons This Happens

**Common causes:**
- Experience revealed something
- Mental health needs change
- Physical changes
- Life circumstances
- Just... not wanting to anymore

### Having the Conversation

**Say:**
- "I need to adjust our agreements"
- "I'm not comfortable with [X] anymore"
- "I need to take [Y] off the table"
- "Something's changed for me"

---

## Partner Response to Changes

### If They're Expanding

**When partner wants more:**
- Listen to their desires
- Consider how you feel
- Be honest about your comfort
- Don't feel pressured

### If They're Contracting

**When partner needs less:**
- Accept without argument
- Don't make them feel bad
- Ask how to support them
- Adjust accordingly

### When Changes Don't Match

**If you're moving different directions:**
- Honest conversation about fit
- Finding workable middle
- Accepting some differences

## Renegotiating Power Exchange

### Dynamic Shifts

**Power dynamics can:**

## Documentation and Memory

### Written Agreements

- Reference point

### Memory Is Unreliable

---

## Regular Check-Ins

**Ask each other:**
- "How is our dynamic feeling?"

## FAQ

**How often should we renegotiate?**
Regular check-ins (monthly-quarterly) plus whenever something significant changes. It's ongoing, not one-time.

**What if my partner doesn't want to renegotiate?**
Healthy dynamics require open communication. Unwillingness to discuss is a red flag. Your needs for the conversation are valid.

**Can I renegotiate mid-scene?**
Use safewords to pause/stop if needed. Full renegotiation should happen outside scenes, but you can always stop and talk.

**What if I want to go back to a previous agreement?**
That's valid. Boundaries can move in any direction. Communicate the change.
