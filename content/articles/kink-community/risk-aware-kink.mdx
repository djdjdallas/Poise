"Safe, Sane, and Consensual" (SSC) served the kink community well for decades. But RACK—Risk-Aware Consensual Kink—offers a more nuanced framework that acknowledges reality: all kink carries some risk.

Here's what RACK means and how to practice it.

---

## What Is RACK?

### The Core Principle

**RACK recognizes:**
- No activity is 100% "safe"
- Informed consent requires knowing risks
- Adults can choose to accept risks
- Personal responsibility matters

### How It Differs from SSC

**SSC says:**
- Activities should be "safe"
- Participants should be "sane"
- Everything should be consensual

**RACK says:**
- All activities carry risk
- Know and accept those risks
- Consent must be informed
- You're responsible for your choices

---

## Why RACK Emerged

### Limitations of "Safe"

**Problems with the word:**
- What's "safe" is subjective
- Some activities can't be made "safe"
- Creates false sense of security
- Used to invalidate edge play

### Limitations of "Sane"

**Problematic because:**
- Ableist implications
- Who defines "sane"?
- Can be used against neurodivergent people
- Subjective judgment

### The Need for Nuance

**RACK provides:**
- Honest risk assessment
- Informed decision-making
- Respect for individual choices
- Framework for edge play

## Practicing RACK

### Step 1: Identify Risks

**For any activity, ask:**
- What could go wrong physically?
- What could go wrong emotionally?
- What's the worst-case scenario?
- What are common problems?

### Step 2: Research and Educate

**Learn about:**
- Specific techniques and safety measures
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Warning signs to watch for
- Emergency procedures

### Step 3: Communicate Risks

**Discuss with partners:**
- Known risks of the activity
- Your experience level
- Any personal risk factors
- Mitigation strategies

### Step 4: Make Informed Decisions

**Each person decides:**
- Whether to accept the risks
- What level of risk is acceptable
- What precautions to require
- When to decline

### Step 5: Accept Responsibility

**Understand:**
- You chose to accept these risks
- You're responsible for your decision
- Things can still go wrong despite precautions
- That's the nature of risk

## Mitigating vs. Eliminating Risk

### You Can Mitigate

**Reduce risk through:**
- Education and skill
- Proper equipment
- Clear communication
- Safety measures

### You Can't Eliminate

**Accept that:**

## RACK and Edge Play

## Consent Under RACK

### What Informed Means

**Partners should know:**

- What risks exist
- What could go wrong
- How you'll handle problems

### Ongoing Consent

**Remember:**

## Criticisms of RACK

### Potential Misuse

**Concerns:**

## RACK and Relationships

### With New Partners

**Extra caution:**
- Build trust first
- Start with lower risk
- Verify skill and knowledge
- Don't rush to intensity

### With Established Partners

**Can be more flexible:**
- Known track record
- Established trust
- Mutual understanding
- Still communicate

### When Risks Increase

**Revisit discussions:**

- Don't assume blanket consent
- Health changes matter
- Keep communication current

## Building a RACK Practice

### Education First

**Invest in learning:**
- Classes and workshops
- Books and resources
- Community knowledge
- Hands-on practice (safely)

### Start Conservative

**Build gradually:**
- Low risk activities first
- Add complexity over time
- Master basics before advancing
- Learn from each experience

### Reflect and Adjust

**After play:**
- What risks materialized?
- What did you learn?
- What would you do differently?
- How does this inform future choices?

## FAQ

**Doesn't RACK mean anything goes?**
No. It means informed consent—you can't consent to what you don't understand. And consent can always be withheld.

**Is RACK only for edge players?**
No. RACK applies to all kink. Even "mild" activities have some risk worth acknowledging.

**How do I know if risks are acceptable?**
That's personal. Research, reflect, and decide what level of risk you're willing to accept for the experiences you want.

**What if my partner uses RACK to pressure me?**
That's misuse. True RACK respects your choice to decline risks you don't want to take.
