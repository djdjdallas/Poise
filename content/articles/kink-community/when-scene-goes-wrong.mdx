The scene isn't going right. Maybe a safeword was called. Maybe someone's crying in a way that doesn't seem okay. Maybe there's an injury. Maybe something just feels deeply wrong.

Scenes go off the rails. It happens to everyone at some point. What matters is how you handle it.

---

## Recognizing That Something Is Wrong

### Obvious Signs

**Clear indicators:**
- Safeword called
- Explicit request to stop
- Physical injury visible
- Panic or distress that doesn't match the scene
- Dissociation (person seems "gone")
- Uncontrolled crying or shaking

### Subtler Signs

**Watch for:**
- Energy suddenly shifting
- Partner going very quiet
- Responses that don't match what's happening
- Body language that's withdrawing
- Eyes that look vacant or checked out
- Something that just feels "off"

### When In Doubt

If you're not sure if something's wrong:

**Stop and check in:**
> "Hey, pausing for a moment. How are you doing? Color?"

Better to check unnecessarily than to miss something important.

---

## Immediate Response

### Step 1: Stop

If a safeword is called or something is clearly wrong:

**Stop immediately.**
- Don't finish what you're doing
- Don't negotiate for "just one more"
- Don't question why they're stopping
- Just stop

### Step 2: Assess the Situation

**Quickly evaluate:**
- Is there physical danger? (Breathing restriction, injury, equipment)
- Is the person conscious and responsive?
- What kind of distress is happening? (Physical? Emotional? Both?)

### Step 3: Address Immediate Needs

**Physical safety first:**
- Remove any equipment that's causing distress (restraints, gags, etc.)
- Address any medical needs
- Get them to a comfortable position
- Cover them if they're cold

**Then emotional safety:**
- Stay present
- Stay calm
- Don't leave them alone

### Step 4: Communicate

**Check in:**
> "I'm here. You're safe. What do you need right now?"

> "Take your time. We can talk about it when you're ready."

**Don't:**
- Demand explanation immediately
- Get defensive
- Make it about you
- Pressure them to talk before they're ready

## Types of Things Going Wrong

### Safeword Called (Planned Stop)

**What it means:** The system worked. They communicated a limit.

**Your response:**
- Stop immediately and completely
- Thank them for communicating
- Provide aftercare
- Debrief later when ready

**Don't:**
- Make them feel bad for calling it
- Express disappointment
- Pressure for reasons immediately
- Resume the scene after a brief pause (unless explicitly discussed)

### Physical Injury

**Unplanned injury during scene:**

**Immediate:**
- Stop the activity
- Assess the injury
- Provide first aid if appropriate
- Seek medical attention if needed

**After:**
- Don't resume the scene
- Focus on physical and emotional care
- Discuss what happened once the person is stable
- Evaluate what went wrong and how to prevent it

**Serious injuries:** Always prioritize medical care. Embarrassment is not a reason to avoid the ER.

### Emotional Trigger

**When trauma or unexpected emotion surfaces:**

**Recognize signs:**
- Sudden shift in emotional state
- Crying that feels different from scene crying
- Panic response
- Flashback indicators
- Shutdown or dissociation

**Respond:**
- Stop immediately
- Don't touch without permission (ask first)
- Help ground them in the present
- Stay calm and present
- Don't try to process the trauma—just be there

**Grounding techniques:**
- "You're safe. You're here with [your name]."
- "Can you feel your feet on the floor?"
- "What's something you can see right now?"
- Offer a blanket, water, something to hold

### Dissociation

**When they "go somewhere else":**

**Signs:**
- Vacant expression
- Not responding to name
- Seems checked out or far away
- Movement becomes automatic or stops

**Response:**
- Stop the scene
- Speak gently: "I'm going to bring you back now"
- Gentle grounding (with their pre-negotiated consent)
- Give time—don't rush the return

### Consent Confusion

**When something happened that wasn't agreed to:**

**If you're the one who crossed:**
- Stop immediately
- Apologize sincerely
- Don't make excuses
- Provide whatever they need
- Be prepared for consequences

**If your consent was violated:**
- You can stop at any time
- You don't owe continued participation
- Your feelings are valid
- You get to decide what happens next

### Technical Failure

**Equipment breaks, rope slips, etc.:**

**Immediate:**
- Address any danger
- Remove equipment if needed
- Check for injury

**After:**
- Assess what went wrong technically
- Decide whether to continue or stop
- Learn for next time

## After Things Go Wrong

### Immediate Aftercare

Aftercare is always important; it's essential when things go wrong:

**Physical:**
- Warmth, water, food
- Comfortable position
- Physical closeness (if wanted)

**Emotional:**
- Presence and reassurance
- No pressure to talk
- Patience with whatever they're feeling
- Validation that stopping was right

### Don't Rush Debrief

**Give it time:**
- Not while either person is still activated
- Not in the immediate aftermath
- When both people have regulated
- Maybe hours or days later

### The Debrief Conversation

**When ready, discuss:**
- What happened from each perspective
- What triggered the problem
- How the response felt
- What could be different next time
- Whether this affects future play

**Approach with:**
- Curiosity, not blame
- Openness to feedback
- Willingness to learn
- Care for each other

### Processing Your Own Response

**If you're the top/dominant:**
You might feel:
- Guilty
- Scared that you hurt them
- Defensive
- Worried about your competence

All normal. Get support (from appropriate sources, maintaining their privacy).

**If you're the bottom/submissive:**
You might feel:
- Embarrassed about stopping
- Confused about your reaction
- Worried about disappointing your partner
- Needing time to process

All valid. Take the time you need.

## For Tops/Dominants

### Your Responsibilities

When things go wrong, you need to:
- Prioritize their safety over the scene
- Stop without resentment
- Provide immediate care
- Not make it about your disappointment
- Take responsibility for your part

### Managing Your Reaction

**Things you might feel:**
- Frustration that the scene stopped
- Fear that you caused harm
- Guilt about what happened
- Defensive about your skills

**What to do:**
- Feel those feelings away from the affected partner
- Don't process your guilt onto them
- Get support from other sources
- Focus on their needs in the immediate aftermath

### After, Take Care of Yourself

Tops need support too. Seek it from:
- Other community members
- Your own support people
- Therapists familiar with kink

Not from the person who was harmed.

## For Bottoms/Submissives

### Your Rights

When something goes wrong, you have every right to:
- Stop without explanation
- Need time before talking
- Have your experience taken seriously
- Decide what happens next
- Take a break from play

### Managing Guilt or Embarrassment

**You might feel:**
- Bad for "ruining" the scene
- Embarrassed about your reaction
- Worried about disappointing your partner
- Confused about what happened

**Remember:**
- Communicating limits is good, not bad
- Your reaction is valid
- A good partner will prioritize your wellbeing
- This doesn't make you broken or bad at kink

## FAQ

**Does a scene going wrong mean we shouldn't play together?**
Not necessarily. How you handle it matters more. If you navigate it well together, it can actually build trust. If it reveals fundamental problems, that's different.

**Should I apologize even if I'm not sure I did anything wrong?**
You can express care without taking blame: "I'm sorry this happened and I'm here for you." If it becomes clear you did something wrong, apologize for that specifically.

**How long should we wait before playing again?**
As long as both people need. Don't rush. Make sure you've processed and discussed before resuming.

**What if they say they're fine but seem not fine?**
Gently express what you're observing: "You're saying you're okay, but you seem shaky. I want to make sure you're really okay before we move on."
