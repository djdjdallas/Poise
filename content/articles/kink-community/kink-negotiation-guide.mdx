Negotiation isn't a buzzkill—it's the foundation of safe, consensual kink. Good negotiation creates the space for everyone to fully enjoy the experience.

This guide walks you through negotiation before, during, and after play, with scripts for each stage.

## Why Negotiation Matters

### What Negotiation Does

- Establishes informed consent
- Identifies limits and desires
- Prevents harm and misunderstandings
- Builds trust between partners
- Creates better, more satisfying experiences

### What Happens Without It

- Boundaries get crossed accidentally
- Trauma gets triggered unexpectedly
- One person has a bad experience
- Trust breaks down
- Kink gets a bad reputation

---

## Before: Pre-Scene Negotiation

### When to Have This Conversation

- Before any play happens
- In a neutral, non-sexual setting
- When both people are sober and clear-headed
- With enough time to discuss thoroughly

### What to Cover

**Basic information:**
- Experience levels
- Current physical/mental state
- Medications or conditions that affect play
- STI status if relevant

**Boundaries:**
- Hard limits (absolute nos)
- Soft limits (maybes with discussion)
- Triggers to avoid

**Desires:**
- What you're hoping to experience
- What's exciting to you
- What you want to explore

**Practical elements:**
- Safewords and signals
- Safe calls and check-ins
- Aftercare needs
- Timeframe

### Script: Starting the Conversation

> "Before we do anything, I want to make sure we're on the same page about boundaries and desires. Can we talk through what's okay, what's off-limits, and what we're both hoping for?"

### Script: Discussing Limits

> "Let's talk about hard limits first—things that are completely off the table, no negotiation. For me, those include [list]. What about you?"

> "Now for soft limits—things that might be okay under certain circumstances or that you're curious about but cautious. Mine are [list]. How about yours?"

### Script: Discussing Desires

> "What are you hoping to get out of this experience? What sounds exciting to you?"

> "For me, I'm really interested in [specific activities]. How do you feel about those?"

### Script: Safewords

> "What safeword system do you use? I typically use [system]. Let's make sure we're using the same one."

**Common systems:**
- **Stoplight:** Red (stop everything), Yellow (pause/check in), Green (good, continue)
- **Plain language:** "Stop" or "Safeword" means stop
- **Non-verbal:** Tap out, drop an object

## Negotiation Frameworks

### The Yes/No/Maybe List

Go through activities together:
- **Yes:** Actively want to do
- **No:** Hard limit
- **Maybe:** Could be open to discussing

Many lists are available online. Go through together, compare notes, discuss.

### The Questions Method

Ask each other:
1. What do you want to experience?
2. What do you definitely not want?
3. What might you be open to?
4. What do you need to feel safe?
5. What aftercare do you need?

### The Scenario Method

If there's a specific scene in mind:
> "Here's what I'm imagining... [describe]. How does that sound? What would you change? What concerns do you have?"

---

## During: In-Scene Communication

### Continuous Consent

Negotiation doesn't end when play begins:
- Check in regularly
- Watch for non-verbal signals
- Respond immediately to safewords
- Adjust based on feedback

### Script: Checking In

> "How are you doing? Color?"

> "Is this intensity working for you?"

> "Do you want more, less, or to keep this pace?"

### Script: Adjusting

> "I'm noticing [observation]. Let's pause and check in."

> "I want to try [activity]. Are you up for that right now?"

### Non-Verbal Communication

Agree on signals beforehand:
- Thumbs up/down
- Tapping out
- Dropping an object
- Specific sounds

Especially important when someone can't speak (gags, etc.).

### When Safewords Are Used

If someone safewords:
- Stop immediately
- Check in with them
- Provide what they need (space, comfort, water)
- Don't push for explanation right away
- No shame or guilt—safewords are for using

---

## After: Debrief and Aftercare

### Immediate Aftercare

What people commonly need after play:
- Physical: Water, blankets, snacks, physical comfort
- Emotional: Reassurance, connection, quiet presence
- Time: Space to process before talking

### Script: Immediate Check-In

> "How are you feeling? What do you need right now?"

> "I'm here with you. Take your time."

### Later Debrief

After some time has passed:
- What worked well?
- What would you do differently?
- Any concerns or things to address?
- What did you learn about each other?

### Script: Debrief Conversation

> "I'd love to talk about how that went when you're ready. No pressure on timing."

> "What was your favorite part? What would you want to adjust next time?"

> "Was there anything that didn't work for you that I should know about?"

### If Something Went Wrong

Things don't always go perfectly:
- Acknowledge what happened
- Take responsibility where appropriate
- Listen without defensiveness
- Discuss how to prevent it in future
- Consider whether to continue playing together

> "I know [thing] happened and that wasn't what we agreed to. I'm sorry. Can we talk about it?"

## Special Considerations

### New Partners

With someone new:
- More detailed negotiation needed
- Start slower and lighter
- Build trust before intense play
- Multiple sessions before high-risk activities

### Ongoing Relationships

With established partners:
- Still negotiate each scene
- Don't assume consent carries over
- Check in about evolving limits
- Regular relationship-level discussions

### Power Exchange Dynamics

In D/s or M/s relationships:
- Negotiate the dynamic itself
- Establish standing agreements
- Define scope and exceptions
- Build in regular review periods

---

## Common Negotiation Challenges

### "This Ruins the Mood"

Actually, it often enhances it:
- Builds anticipation
- Creates trust that enables deeper surrender
- Ensures everyone is genuinely into it
- Good communication is sexy

### "I Don't Know What I Want"

That's okay:
> "I'm still figuring out what I like. Can we start slow and check in frequently?"

### "They Got Offended"

If someone reacts badly to negotiation questions, that's a red flag:
- Safe partners welcome safety discussions
- Offense at boundaries = not a safe partner
- Trust that reaction as information

### Unequal Experience Levels

When one person is more experienced:
- More experienced person should lead negotiation
- Never pressure the less experienced person
- Go at the pace of the less experienced
- Educate without condescending
