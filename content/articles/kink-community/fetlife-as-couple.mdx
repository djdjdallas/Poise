You and your partner are exploring kink together and want to use FetLife. But how does that work? One profile or two? Who messages? How do you represent yourselves?

Here's everything you need to know about using FetLife as a couple.

---

## Joint Profile vs. Separate Profiles

### Option 1: Joint Profile

**How it works:**
- One account shared between both partners
- Profile represents both people
- Messages come from "us"
- Clearly labeled as a couple

**Pros:**
- Simple logistics
- Clear that you come as a package
- No confusion about who's who
- Unified presence

**Cons:**
- Less individual identity
- Some people won't interact with couple profiles
- One person often does more work
- Can't have private conversations

### Option 2: Separate Profiles (Linked)

**How it works:**
- Each person has their own account
- Profiles link to each other (relationship status)
- Individual interests and kinks listed
- Interact separately but connected

**Pros:**
- Individual identity preserved
- More approachable to some
- Can develop separate connections
- Better for different kink interests

**Cons:**
- More accounts to manage
- Requires coordination
- Can be confusing if not clearly linked
- Might attract people who miss the "coupled" status

### Option 3: Separate and Unlisted

**How it works:**
- Separate accounts with no public link
- May or may not mention partnership
- More privacy about relationship

**Pros:**
- Maximum privacy
- Individual exploration space
- Some prefer this approach

**Cons:**
- May seem like you're hiding something
- Ethical concerns about disclosure
- Can create problems if discovered

**Recommendation:** Most couples do best with either a joint profile or linked separate profiles. Transparency is valued in the kink community.

## Setting Up a Joint Profile

### Profile Basics

**Name format options:**
- "John and Jane"
- "J&J_Adventure"
- "TheMidwestCouple"
- Names that clearly indicate two people

**Avatar:**
- Photo of both (if photo-sharing)
- Artwork representing both
- Clear "couple" indicator

### Writing the Bio

**Include:**
- Who you both are (names, identities)
- What you're looking for together
- Individual kink interests (can differ)
- How you prefer to communicate
- Boundaries about individual vs. joint connections

**Example structure:**
> "We're [names], a [dynamic] couple exploring kink together. [Brief background]. [Person 1] is into [interests]. [Person 2] enjoys [interests]. We're looking for [what you want]. We respond together and play together."

### Relationship Status

**Be clear:**
- "In a relationship with [partner]" (if separate account exists)
- State coupled status prominently in bio
- Clarify if you're open to connections beyond each other

---

## Setting Up Linked Separate Profiles

### Linking Your Accounts

**FetLife's relationship feature:**
1. Go to your profile
2. Add relationship
3. Enter partner's FetLife username
4. They confirm on their end
5. Relationship displays on both profiles

### Cross-Referencing in Bios

**Additionally mention:**
> "Partnered with @[username]. We explore kink together and communicate openly."

### Coordinating Individual Profiles

**Discuss:**
- What each person will list as interests
- How to handle messages about the other person
- What information is shared vs. private
- How to represent the relationship

---

## Navigating Messages and Connections

### With a Joint Profile

**Who responds:**
- Agree on who checks messages
- Consider rotating or both involved
- Make it clear who's writing
- Sign messages with initials if desired

**Example:**
> "Thanks for reaching out! This is Jane responding. John and I both read your message and would love to hear more about..."

### With Separate Profiles

**Coordination:**
- Share relevant messages with each other
- Don't keep connections secret
- Refer people to partner if appropriate
- Be honest about your coupled status

**Example:**
> "Thanks for the message! Just so you know, I'm partnered—my partner @[username] and I communicate openly. Happy to chat more!"

## Attending Events as a Couple

### Event Considerations

**Planning together:**
- Which events interest both of you?
- Who do you want to meet there?
- What are your couple agreements about play at events?
- How do you handle if one is interested in something the other isn't?

### Behavior at Events

- Anything uncomfortable to address?
- What do we want to do differently next time?

## Common Challenges

### Unicorn Hunting Perception

**The issue:**
- Couples seeking "unicorns" (single bi women) have a bad reputation
- Can be seen as entitled or predatory
- May get fewer responses because of this perception

**How to avoid:**
- Treat thirds as full people, not accessories
- Don't message everyone with the same request
- Show genuine interest in individuals
- Be willing to invest in getting to know someone
- Consider what you're offering, not just what you want

### Different Kink Interests

**When partners don't align:**
- Profile can list individual interests
- Be clear about what requires partner participation
- Consider what each is willing to try vs. excited about
- Don't misrepresent compatibility to attract matches

### Jealousy and Comparison

**Managing feelings:**
- One partner might get more attention
- One might have kinks that attract more interest
- Communication about feelings is essential
- Don't keep score

### Decision-Making

**For joint profiles:**
- Who decides what to respond to?
- How do you make decisions about connections?
- What happens when you disagree?
- Establish process before conflict arises

---

## Ethical Practices

### Transparency

**Always:**
- Be honest about being a couple
- Disclose your relationship status early
- Don't pretend to be single
- Don't surprise people with "oh, actually there are two of us"

### Individual Autonomy

**Remember:**
- Each partner can have boundaries
- One person can veto without explanation
- Both must consent to joint activities
- Individual comfort matters

### Treating Others Well

**Thirds and connections are people:**
- Not accessories to your relationship
- Have their own needs and boundaries
- Deserve respect and consideration
- Are doing you a favor by engaging

## Building Community as a Couple

### Finding Couple-Friendly Spaces

**Where to look:**
- Local FetLife groups for couples
- Events that welcome couples
- Other couples to befriend
- Mentors who can guide you

### Being Good Community Members

**Together:**
- Attend munches and events
- Contribute positively
- Support others' journeys
- Build relationships beyond just "finding play partners"

### Developing Your Dynamic

**FetLife can help:**
- Learn from other couples
- Find resources and education
- Explore new possibilities
- Connect with community wisdom

## FAQ

**Should we disclose we're a couple right away?**
Yes. Waiting until later feels deceptive. State it in your profile and mention it early in any connection.

**What if one of us gets more attention?**
This is common. Talk about it, validate feelings, and remember you're a team. Some attention imbalances are structural (gender, kink role, etc.).

**Can we each have individual connections?**
That's up to you to decide together. Many couples allow this with agreements and transparency. Others don't. Neither is wrong.

**How do we handle someone interested in only one of us?**
Decide your policy in advance. Some couples are flexible; others always come as a package. Communicate your approach clearly.
