FetLife contains sensitive information about your kink interests and activities. Understanding and configuring your privacy settings is essential for protecting yourself.

Here's a complete guide to FetLife's privacy options.

---

## Profile Visibility

### Who Can See Your Profile

**Current default:**
- Only logged-in FetLife members can view profiles
- FetLife is not indexed by search engines
- No public profiles visible to non-members
- This provides baseline privacy

### What This Means

**Privacy baseline:**
- Your profile won't appear in Google searches
- Vanilla friends won't stumble upon you (unless they're on FetLife too)
- Anyone on FetLife can potentially view you (unless you restrict further)

---

## Photo Privacy Settings

### Photo Visibility Options

**For each photo, you can set:**
- **Friends only:** Only your FetLife friends can see
- **All members:** Any logged-in FetLife user can see
- **Specific lists:** Custom friend lists with access

### Managing Photo Access

**How to configure:**
1. Go to your photos
2. Click on individual photo settings
3. Choose visibility level
4. Apply to specific photos or albums

### Strategic Photo Privacy

**Recommendations:**
- Face photos: Friends only (or don't upload)
- Identifying photos: Friends only
- Non-identifying content: Your discretion
- NSFW content: Consider friends only

---

## Friend List Settings

### Who Can See Your Friends

**Options:**
- Public to all members
- Friends only
- Only you

### Why This Matters

**Considerations:**
- Friend lists reveal community associations
- Could link you to specific groups or people
- Some prefer hiding for discretion
- Others show for community credibility

### Recommendation

If privacy is a concern, set friend list to "friends only" or "only you."

---

## Fetish List Settings

### Visibility of Your Interests

**Your fetish list can be:**
- Visible to all members
- Visible to friends only
- Hidden entirely

### What to Consider

**Tradeoffs:**
- Visible lists help compatible people find you
- Hidden lists protect from judgment or targeting
- Some people are strategic about what's shown
- You can list nothing and explain interests in bio instead

---

## Messaging Controls

### Who Can Message You

**Options:**
- Anyone
- Friends only
- Friends and friends of friends
- Specific criteria

### Message Filtering

**Additional controls:**
- Some versions have filtering by profile age
- Can block specific users
- Can limit based on various criteria

### Recommendation

**For most people:**
- Allow messages from friends and friends of friends
- Or anyone, but be prepared to filter
- Adjust based on the attention you receive

---

## Activity Visibility

### Love and Comment Visibility

**What others can see:**
- Posts you've loved
- Comments you've made
- Activity feed entries

### Controlling Activity Visibility

**Options:**
- Activity may be visible in friends' feeds
- Some activity settings are configurable
- Be aware that interactions leave traces

### Being Strategic

**Consider:**
- Your "loves" are visible to others
- Comments you make appear on public posts
- Your activity paints a picture of your interests
- Liking controversial content may be visible

---

## Location Settings

### How Location Works

**What's shown:**
- General location (city/region)
- Used for finding local events and people
- Doesn't show precise address

### Location Privacy Options

**You can:**
- Set a general region
- Use a nearby larger city
- Be vague about exact location
- Update when traveling (or not)

### Recommendations

**Balance:**
- Accurate enough to find local community
- Vague enough to maintain privacy
- Consider using nearby city if small town

---

## Group Privacy

### Group Membership Visibility

**What others can see:**
- Groups you've joined (sometimes)
- Posts you make in groups
- Your role in groups

### Private vs. Public Groups

**Types:**
- Public groups: Membership and posts visible
- Private groups: Content hidden, membership may be visible
- Secret groups: Not searchable, membership hidden

### Considerations

**Before joining:**
- Is this group's membership visible?
- Will joining reveal something about you?
- Are the discussions you'll participate in public?

---

## Event Privacy

### RSVP Visibility

**What's visible:**
- Events you RSVP to may show you as attending
- Some events have hidden attendee lists
- Your RSVP may be visible to event organizers

### Event Considerations

**Before RSVPing:**
- Who can see the attendee list?
- Is this event public knowledge you're comfortable with?
- Does the event have privacy protections?

---

## Blocking and Restrictions

### Blocking Users

**What blocking does:**
- They can't view your profile
- They can't message you
- They can't see your content
- You won't see their content

**How to block:**
1. Go to their profile
2. Click the options menu
3. Select "Block"
4. Confirm

### When to Block

**Good reasons:**
- Harassment
- Boundary violations
- Anyone making you uncomfortable
- You don't need to justify blocking

### Limitations of Blocking

**Be aware:**
- They may notice they're blocked
- Mutual friends may still mention you
- Determined people can create new accounts
- Blocking isn't invisibility

---

## Additional Privacy Features

**Enable 2FA:**
- Protects your account from hacking
- Required for account changes
- Adds security layer

**How to enable:**
- Settings → Security
- Enable two-factor authentication
