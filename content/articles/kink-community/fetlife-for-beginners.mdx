FetLife is the largest online kink community, but it's not like other social networks. If you're new, the interface can be confusing and the culture unfamiliar.

Here's your complete beginner's guide to getting started on FetLife.

## What Is FetLife?

### Not a Dating App

**Important distinction:**
- FetLife is a social network, not a dating/hookup app
- Think kinky Facebook, not kinky Tinder
- No swiping, matching, or algorithm-based recommendations
- Connections happen through community engagement

### What It's For

**Primary uses:**
- Connecting with local kink community
- Finding events (munches, parties, classes)
- Learning and education
- Building reputation and relationships
- Finding play partners (eventually, through community)

### The Culture

**What to know:**
- Community-oriented, not transactional
- Reputation matters
- Patience is expected
- Entitlement is not tolerated
- It's a marathon, not a sprint

## Setting Up Your Profile

### About Me Section

**What to include:**
- Who you are (as much as you're comfortable sharing)
- Your experience level with kink
- What you're interested in
- What you're looking for (community, friends, education, eventually partners)
- What you're NOT looking for

**Good beginner bio example:**
> "New to the scene and exploring what BDSM means to me. Currently focused on learning and finding community. I'm interested in [interests] and excited to meet people at local events. Not looking for play partners yet—just here to learn and connect."

### Your Role/Identity

**Options:**
- Dominant, submissive, switch
- Top, bottom, versatile
- Master, slave, pet, etc.
- "Exploring" or "Unsure" are valid options
- You can change this as you learn more

### Orientation and Gender

**FetLife offers many options:**
- More gender options than most sites
- Multiple orientation options
- Choose what feels right
- Can be updated anytime

### Location

**Setting your location:**
- Helps find local community
- Can be general (city) rather than specific
- Enables you to find local events and groups
- Some people use nearby city for privacy

## Fetishes and Interests

### The Fetish List

**How it works:**
- FetLife has a huge list of kinks/fetishes
- You mark each as:
  - Into it
  - Curious about
  - Soft limit
  - Hard limit
- These appear on your profile

### As a Beginner

**Don't feel pressure to:**
- Know all your kinks already
- List everything immediately
- Have extensive lists
- Commit to things you're unsure about

**Good approach:**
- Mark things you know you're curious about
- Leave unknowns blank
- Add as you learn more
- "Curious about" is a valid category

---

## Privacy and Safety

### Photo Decisions

**Options:**
- No photos (allowed and common for beginners)
- Face-free photos
- Full photos (with privacy settings)
- Avatar or non-personal image

**Privacy considerations:**
- Assume anything on FetLife could be seen
- Face photos are higher risk
- Consider your professional/personal life
- You can start with no photos and add later

### Privacy Settings

**What you can control:**
- Who sees your profile (members only is default)
- Who can message you
- Who can see your photos
- Your friend list visibility

**Recommended settings for beginners:**
- Keep profile visible to members only
- Enable message filtering
- Don't upload photos until you understand the platform
- Review settings periodically

### Protecting Your Identity

**If privacy matters:**
- Use a separate email for FetLife
- Don't link to other social media
- Be vague about identifying details
- Consider a VPN for browsing

5. NOT messaging people for play immediately

### What NOT to Do

- Ignoring community norms

### Building Presence

**Good first actions:**

- Ask questions politely
- Be patient and consistent

## Messaging Etiquette

### Who to Message

**Appropriate:**
- People you've met at events
- Group members you've interacted with
- Writers whose work you genuinely appreciated
- People whose profiles indicate openness to messages

**Inappropriate:**
- Random profiles for play requests
- Everyone with a specific fetish
- Anyone without reading their profile first
- People whose profiles say "don't message me"

### How to Message

**Good first messages:**
- Reference something specific (their writing, meeting at an event)
- Be respectful and non-presumptuous
- Don't immediately ask for play
- Show you've read their profile

**Example:**
> "Hi, I really enjoyed your writing on [topic]. I'm new to FetLife and your perspective on [specific thing] was helpful. Thanks for sharing."

### What to Avoid

**Message turn-offs:**
- "Hey sexy"
- Immediate kink/play requests
- Copy-paste messages
- Asking personal questions right away
- Anything sexual without established rapport

- Ask in local groups

### Other Event Types

### Event Etiquette

**At munches:**

## FAQ

**Is FetLife safe?**
It's as safe as you make it. Use good privacy practices, don't share identifying info immediately, and meet people at public events first.

**Will people find out I'm on FetLife?**
Not unless they're on FetLife too. The site isn't indexed by search engines. But nothing online is 100% private.

**How long before I find a play partner?**
Varies widely. People who engage with community, attend events, and build relationships over months often do better than those seeking quick connections.

**I'm nervous about being new. Will people judge me?**
The community generally welcomes genuine newbies. What's judged is entitlement, bad behavior, and not doing your homework.
