Ethical non-monogamy has a learning curve. Most people make mistakes along the way—that's part of growth. But some mistakes are so common that you can learn from others who've made them.

## Relationship Foundation Mistakes

### 1. Opening to Fix Problems

**The mistake:**
Opening a struggling relationship hoping new partners will:
- Distract from existing issues
- Meet needs current partner can't
- Create positive energy
- Prevent breakup

**Why it fails:**
- Problems don't disappear
- ENM adds stress, not relief
- Issues compound with complexity
- Foundation crumbles faster

**Instead:**
- Fix problems first, then consider opening
- Be honest about why you want ENM
- Don't use new partners as band-aids
- Build strong foundation before adding complexity

### 2. One Person Wants It, One Doesn't

**The mistake:**
- Partner pressures resistant partner to open up
- Reluctant agreement under duress
- "I'll try it for you" without genuine desire

**Why it fails:**
- Resentment builds
- Power imbalance from start
- Reluctant partner often hurt
- Usually ends badly

**Instead:**
- Both must genuinely want this
- "No" is a complete answer
- May mean incompatibility
- Don't coerce or pressure

### 3. Not Doing the Work

**The mistake:**
- Jumping in without education
- Assuming love is enough
- Skipping books, therapy, community
- Winging it

**Why it fails:**
- Reinvent every wheel
- Make preventable mistakes
- Lack tools for challenges
- Miss important concepts

**Instead:**
- Read the foundational books
- Consider therapy (especially early)
- Join communities for support
- Learn from others' experiences

## Communication Mistakes

### 4. Assuming Your Partner Knows

**The mistake:**
- Not saying things explicitly
- Assuming they'd bring it up if bothered
- Mind-reading expectations
- "They should just know"

**Why it fails:**
- People aren't telepathic
- Assumptions create conflict
- Resentment builds silently
- Surprises when needs unmet

**Instead:**
- Say what you need directly
- Check assumptions explicitly
- Don't expect mind-reading
- Overcommunicate early on

### 5. Don't Ask, Don't Tell

**The mistake:**
- Agreement to not discuss outside relationships
- "What I don't know won't hurt me"
- Avoiding uncomfortable truths

**Why it fails:**
- Creates secrets, not privacy
- Often backfires when discovered
- Prevents genuine connection
- Hides compatibility issues

**Instead:**
- Find communication level that works
- Some privacy is fine; secrecy isn't
- Address avoidance honestly
- What level of information do you both need?

### 6. Treating Partners Like Therapists

**The mistake:**
- Processing every feeling with partner
- Expecting them to manage your emotions
- Over-relying on their support
- Making them responsible for your feelings

**Why it fails:**
- Exhausting for them
- Creates unfair burden
- Can feel manipulative
- Limits their freedom

**Instead:**
- Develop self-soothing skills
- Have multiple support sources
- Therapy for big processing
- Share feelings without making them problems to solve

## New Relationship Mistakes

### 7. NRE Negligence

**The mistake:**
- New relationship energy consumes you
- Existing partner(s) neglected
- Can't stop thinking/talking about new person
- Making decisions based on NRE

**Why it fails:**
- Established relationships wither
- Partners feel abandoned
- Decisions regretted when NRE fades
- Trust damaged

**Instead:**
- Recognize NRE for what it is
- Protect time with existing partners
- Don't make major decisions in NRE
- Balance new excitement with established connection

### 8. Couple's Privilege Unchecked

**The mistake:**
- Treating new partners as accessories
- Rules that protect couple at new partner's expense
- "We come first" as default
- New partners disposable

**Why it fails:**
- Hurts real people
- Creates resentment
- New partners eventually resist
- Ethical issues

**Instead:**
- Recognize new partners as full people
- Examine rules for fairness
- Consider all affected parties
- Balance needs thoughtfully

### 9. Comparing Relationships

**The mistake:**
- "Why don't we have what they have?"
- Measuring against other relationships
- Jealousy based on perceived differences
- Competition mindset

**Why it fails:**
- Each relationship is unique
- Comparison breeds resentment
- Misses what you actually have
- Can't win this game

**Instead:**
- Each relationship has its own value
- Focus on what you need
- Ask for what you want without comparison
- Celebrate different strengths

## Agreement Mistakes

### 10. Too Many Rules

**The mistake:**
- Rules for every scenario
- Trying to control outcomes
- Restricting to prevent jealousy
- Agreements that constrain growth

**Why it fails:**
- Rules can't prevent hurt
- Creates false security
- Often broken or resented
- Inhibits authentic connection

**Instead:**
- Focus on values over rules
- Fewer, more meaningful agreements
- Build trust, not constraints
- Revisit and adjust as needed

### 11. Veto Power Misuse

**The mistake:**

- Using it to manage your own insecurity
- Wielding it without consideration
- Not examining why you want it

**Why it fails:**
- Hurts third parties
- Often about control, not safety
- Doesn't address underlying issues
- Erodes trust over time

**Instead:**
- Examine need for veto
- Use only for genuine concerns
- Address your own feelings directly
- Consider impact on all parties

### 12. Unchanging Agreements

**The mistake:**
- "We agreed to this" as permanent
- Never revisiting initial rules
- People change, agreements don't
- Holding to outdated agreements

**Why it fails:**
- People and relationships evolve
- Initial agreements often need updating
- Creates resentment
- Prevents growth

**Instead:**
- Schedule regular agreement reviews
- Renegotiate as needed
- Agreements serve relationships, not reverse
- Flexibility is strength

## Emotional Mistakes

### 13. Avoiding Jealousy Instead of Processing

- Avoidance limits growth
- Doesn't build resilience
- Creates fragile structures

**Instead:**

- It's information, not enemy
- Build coping skills
- Jealousy often decreases with practice

### 14. Not Addressing Attachment Issues
