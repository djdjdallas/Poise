## FAQ

**How do I know if I'm polyamorous or just interested?**
The only way to know is to explore—through reading, reflection, and eventually experience. Interest doesn't obligate action.

**Can ENM work long-term?**
Absolutely. Many people sustain ENM relationships for decades. It requires ongoing work, like any relationship style.

**What about jealousy?**
Jealousy is normal and manageable. It's information, not prohibition. Most people learn to work with it.

**Is this just cheating with permission?**
No. Cheating involves deception. ENM involves full knowledge, consent, and ethical practice. They're fundamentally different.
