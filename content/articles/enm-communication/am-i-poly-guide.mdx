## Understanding the Question

### "Am I Polyamorous?" Can Mean Different Things

**Do I have the capacity to love multiple people?**
Most people can—polyamory is about whether you want to structure your life around it.

**Is polyamory my orientation?**
Some people feel polyamory is who they are; others see it as a choice they make.

**Would polyamory make me happy?**
This is often the most useful question.

**Can I do polyamory well?**
Capacity and desire are different from execution.

### A More Useful Frame

Instead of "Am I poly?" ask:
- "Would polyamorous relationships serve me?"
- "Am I drawn to this life structure?"
- "Can I do the work polyamory requires?"

## Self-Assessment Part 1: Your Feelings About Love

### Questions to Reflect On

**About loving multiple people:**
- Have you felt romantic love for more than one person at the same time?
- Did that feel natural, or conflicting and guilty?
- Can you imagine loving multiple partners without comparison or hierarchy?

**About partner's other loves:**
- How do you feel imagining your partner loving someone else?
- Can you distinguish discomfort from genuine harm?
- Could you feel happy for a partner's joy with another?

**About exclusivity:**
- Does romantic exclusivity feel protective and good, or constraining?
- When you imagine a lifetime of monogamy, how does it feel?
- Have you felt limited by monogamous structures in past relationships?

### What Your Answers Might Suggest

**Strong poly indicators:**
- Consistently felt love for multiple people
- Exclusivity has felt constraining
- Idea of partner's other loves brings curiosity, not just fear

**Strong mono indicators:**
- Exclusivity feels important and good
- Other loves feel primarily threatening
- One deep partnership is what you crave

**Uncertain:**
- Mixed feelings are normal
- Real understanding often comes from experience
- Uncertainty doesn't mean you shouldn't explore

## Self-Assessment Part 2: Your Motivations

### Why Are You Considering Polyamory?

**Reasons that often work well:**
- Genuine desire for multiple meaningful relationships
- Belief that love isn't scarce
- Interest in the relationship style itself
- Values alignment with non-monogamy

**Reasons that often cause problems:**
- Partner wants it and you're going along
- Current relationship isn't working
- Hoping to find "better" while keeping "okay"
- Avoiding commitment or intimacy

**Red flags for your motivation:**
- You want polyamory so you can date, but hope partner doesn't
- You see it as solution to specific relationship problems
- You're running from something rather than toward something

### Honest Reflection Questions

- What do I hope to gain from polyamory?
- What am I afraid of losing?
- Would I still want this if my current relationship were perfect?
- Am I excited about this, or just going along?

## Self-Assessment Part 3: Your Capacity

### Polyamory Requires Specific Skills

**Communication:**
- Can you articulate your feelings clearly?
- Can you have difficult conversations without shutting down?
- Can you listen without defensiveness?

**Emotional regulation:**
- Can you feel difficult emotions without acting destructively?
- Can you self-soothe when triggered?
- Can you sit with discomfort rather than demanding immediate resolution?

**Time management:**
- Can you balance multiple priorities?
- Are you organized with calendars and commitments?
- Do you follow through on plans?

**Self-awareness:**
- Do you know your needs and boundaries?
- Can you distinguish jealousy from other emotions?
- Are you honest with yourself?

### Capacity Assessment

Rate yourself 1-10 on each skill. Below 5 on any area suggests work to do before poly will go smoothly—though you can develop these skills over time.

## Self-Assessment Part 4: Your Circumstances

### Is Now a Good Time?

**Questions about current life:**
- Do I have bandwidth for additional relationships?
- Is my primary relationship (if any) stable?
- Are there major life stressors that would complicate this?
- Do I have support systems beyond romantic partners?

**Questions about resources:**
- Do I have time for multiple relationships?
- Can I afford the cost of dating multiple people?
- Is my living situation compatible?
- Do I live somewhere with an ENM community?

### Circumstantial Considerations

Even if polyamory is right for you:
- The timing might not be right
- External factors matter
- You can want something that doesn't currently fit your life

This doesn't mean "never"—it might mean "not yet."

## Self-Assessment Part 5: Your Fears and Concerns

### Common Fears Worth Examining

**Fear: "I'll get jealous and ruin everything"**
Reality: Everyone experiences jealousy. It's manageable, not disqualifying.

**Fear: "My partner will find someone better"**
Reality: This fear exists in monogamy too. It's about security, not relationship structure.

**Fear: "I'm not attractive/interesting enough for this"**
Reality: Polyamory isn't a competition. Connection happens at all "attractiveness" levels.

**Fear: "I'll lose my current relationship"**
Reality: Valid concern. Opening up does carry risk. So does staying closed.

### Distinguishing Fears

**Fears worth listening to:**
- "This doesn't feel right for me fundamentally"
- "I'm doing this to please someone else"
- "My relationship isn't stable enough"

**Fears to work through:**
- "I might feel jealous" (yes, you will—that's normal)
- "It sounds hard" (it is—but so is any meaningful thing)
- "What will people think?" (their opinions aren't your life)

## Self-Assessment Part 6: Imagining the Reality

### Visualization Exercise

Close your eyes and imagine:

**Scenario 1:** Your partner is on a date with someone new. They come home happy, with stories to share. How do you feel?

**Scenario 2:** You have two partners you love deeply. Scheduling is complex but working. How do you feel?

**Scenario 3:** A partner's other relationship is struggling, and they need support from you. How do you feel?

**Scenario 4:** A metamour becomes important in your life—you care about each other. How do you feel?

**Scenario 5:** It's hard—there's jealousy, scheduling conflicts, miscommunication. But you're working through it together. How do you feel?

### What Your Visualizations Tell You

- Consistent dread might mean mono is better for you
- Mix of excitement and anxiety is normal for considering poly
- Genuine curiosity and interest is a positive indicator
- Imagining yourself happy in these scenarios matters

## After the Self-Assessment

### If You Think Yes

**Next steps:**
- Continue learning (books, podcasts, community)
- Talk with partner(s) if applicable
- Start with low-stakes exploration
- Build skills you identified as weak
- Go slowly

### If You Think No

**That's valid:**
- Monogamy is not inferior
- Knowing yourself is valuable
- You can revisit later if things change
- There's no shame in choosing monogamy

### If You're Still Uncertain

**That's okay:**
- Uncertainty is honest
- Some clarity comes only from experience
- You can explore cautiously
- Give yourself permission not to know yet

---

## What Others Can't Tell You

### Your Partner's Opinion

They may want you to be poly (or not). But their preference doesn't determine your identity.

### The Internet's Opinion

Quizzes and articles (including this one) are tools, not verdicts.

### Society's Pressure

Neither "polyamory is evolution" nor "monogamy is the only way" is universally true. Your relationship structure is yours to determine.

---

## Questions to Keep Asking

### Ongoing Inquiry

This isn't a one-time assessment. Keep asking:
- "Is this working for me?"
- "Am I happy?"
- "What do I actually want?"

### Permission to Change

You might think you're poly and discover you're not. Or vice versa. Or discover something more nuanced. That's growth, not failure.
