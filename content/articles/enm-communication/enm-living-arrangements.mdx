In monogamy, the path is clear: date, move in together, maybe buy a house. In ethical non-monogamy, living arrangements are more complex. Who do you live with? How do you host other partners? What structures actually work?

Here are the options and what to consider for each.

---

## Living Arrangement Options

### Option 1: Living with One Nesting Partner

**What it looks like:**
You live with one partner (your "nesting partner") and have other relationships that don't involve cohabitation.

**How it works:**
- Your home is shared with one person
- Other partners visit or you visit them
- The nesting partner often has more practical integration (shared finances, domestic duties)

**Advantages:**
- Clear home base and stability
- Familiar domestic partnership model
- Easier to explain to outside world
- Financial benefits of shared housing

**Challenges:**
- Can create implicit hierarchy
- Other partners may feel secondary
- Hosting space for other relationships
- Nesting partner's comfort with visitors

### Option 2: Solo Living (Solo Poly)

**What it looks like:**
You maintain your own living space, not cohabiting with any partner.

**How it works:**
- Your home is yours alone
- Partners visit but don't live with you
- Each relationship has similar access (none are co-housed)
- You control your space and schedule

**Advantages:**
- No built-in hierarchy from living situation
- Full autonomy over your space
- Privacy and independence
- Flexibility in how each relationship develops

**Challenges:**
- Financial cost of solo living
- Lack of domestic partnership benefits
- Can feel isolating
- Logistical complexity for overnights

### Option 3: Living with Multiple Partners

**What it looks like:**
You share a home with more than one romantic partner.

**Configurations:**
- All partners live together (V, triad, quad, etc.)
- Partners live in same building, different units
- Intentional community with romantic and non-romantic members

**How it works:**
- Multiple people share domestic space
- Requires agreements about shared spaces, privacy, visitors
- Financial arrangements can be complex
- Household management involves multiple adults

**Advantages:**
- Integration of multiple relationships
- Shared resources and costs
- Built-in community
- Less time lost to travel between partners

**Challenges:**
- Complex group dynamics
- Privacy concerns
- Disagreements affect everyone
- Finding suitable housing
- If relationships change, housing is affected

### Option 4: Neighboring

**What it looks like:**
Partners live separately but nearby—same building, same block, same neighborhood.

**How it works:**
- Each person/couple has their own space
- Easy access to each other
- Maintains autonomy while reducing distance

**Advantages:**
- Proximity without cohabitation
- Each relationship has dedicated space
- Flexibility and privacy
- Can scale up or down easily

**Challenges:**
- Requires luck or resources to achieve
- May feel like a compromise
- Neighborhood dynamics if things change

## Considerations for Each Arrangement

### Financial Considerations

**Questions to address:**
- Who pays for what?
- How are shared expenses divided?
- What about assets and equity?
- How does income difference affect contributions?
- What happens if someone moves out?

**For solo living:**
- Can you afford it?
- Is it worth the cost for the autonomy?

**For cohabitation:**
- Fair division of costs
- Legal protections (whose name is on the lease/deed?)
- Financial impact of relationship changes

### Space and Privacy

**Questions to address:**
- Where can partners spend time with you?
- How do you handle visits from other partners?
- What's off-limits in your space?
- How much privacy does each person need?

**Practical solutions:**
- Guest bedrooms or spaces
- Clear agreements about when space is available
- Soundproofing or privacy considerations
- Schedules that provide alone time

### Hosting Other Partners

**When living with a nesting partner:**
- Is hosting allowed?
- What spaces are available?
- How much notice is needed?
- What makes your nesting partner comfortable?

**Sample agreement:**
> "Other partners can visit and stay overnight. Guest room is available. 24-hour notice preferred. No hosting when nesting partner is having a hard time without conversation first."

### When Relationships Change

**Consider in advance:**
- What if a nesting relationship ends?
- What if someone wants to move in?
- What if someone wants to move out?
- How do you handle transitions?

**Protective measures:**
- Lease agreements that allow for change
- Financial plans for various scenarios
- Communication agreements about big decisions

## Making Decisions About Living Arrangements

### What to Consider

**Your values:**
- How important is autonomy vs. partnership?
- Do you want domestic partnership or independence?
- How do you want hierarchy to play out (if at all)?

**Your resources:**
- Can you afford to live alone?
- Do you need a partner's income to afford housing?
- What housing is available in your area?

**Your relationships:**
- What do your partners want?
- What would changing arrangements mean for each relationship?
- Is everyone aligned on living situation goals?

### Conversations to Have

**With yourself:**
- What living situation would I thrive in?
- What are my non-negotiables?
- What am I willing to compromise on?

**With partners:**
- What are your hopes for living arrangements?
- How would various configurations affect you?
- What concerns do you have?

### Taking It Step by Step

You don't have to figure it all out at once:
- Start with what's currently working and not working
- Identify what you'd ideally want
- Explore what's possible given constraints
- Make incremental changes as appropriate

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Adding a Partner When You Live Together

**Situation:** You live with Partner A. Partner B is becoming more serious and wants more integration.

**Questions:**
- What does Partner B want? (More visits? Moving in? Living nearby?)
- How does Partner A feel about changes?
- What space constraints exist?
- How would this affect the relationship balance?

**Possible approaches:**
- More overnight hosting
- Partner B getting their own place nearby
- Moving to a larger space with room for hosting
- In some cases, communal living

### Scenario 2: Transitioning to Solo Poly

**Situation:** You live with a partner but want more autonomy. Considering solo living.

**Questions:**
- Why is solo living appealing?
- What would it mean for your nesting partnership?
- Can you afford it?
- Is your partner open to this change?

**Possible approaches:**
- Discussing the desire and its origins
- Exploring what specifically isn't working
- Gradual transition (staying separately some nights)
- Full transition to separate spaces

### Scenario 3: Combining Households

**Situation:** You want to live with multiple partners or have them live together.

**Questions:**
- Is everyone enthusiastically on board?
- What are the household logistics?
- How will finances work?
- What happens if it doesn't work out?

**Before proceeding:**
- Extended time together first (vacations, long visits)
- Clear agreements about household management
- Financial and legal planning
- Exit strategy conversations

## When Living Situations Create Hierarchy

### The Unspoken Impact

Cohabitation creates practical hierarchy even if you don't intend it:
- More time together
- More domestic integration
- More convenience for the relationship
- Different visibility to the world

### Addressing It

**Acknowledge it:**
> "Living with Partner A means they get more of my daily life. I want to make sure you know that's about logistics, not importance."

**Compensate where possible:**
- Dedicated quality time with non-nesting partners
- Integration in other ways (meeting friends, attending events)
- Clear communication about what cohabitation does and doesn't mean

**Consider alternatives:**
- Could a different arrangement work better?
- Is the current hierarchy acceptable to everyone?
- What would a more equitable setup look like?

---

## FAQ

**Is solo poly more ethical than nesting?**
No. Both are valid choices with different tradeoffs. What matters is honest communication and everyone's needs being considered.

**Can you have a nesting partner and practice non-hierarchical poly?**
It's complicated. Cohabitation creates practical hierarchy even without intentional hierarchy. Being honest about this is important.

**What if my partners want different living arrangements?**
Navigate it through communication. Sometimes compromises exist; sometimes there are genuine incompatibilities to work through.

**How do I bring up wanting to change our living situation?**
Honestly and kindly. Frame it around your needs and desires, not criticism of the current situation. Be open to dialogue.
