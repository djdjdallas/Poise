Having conflict with one partner is hard enough. When you're arguing with multiple partners simultaneously, it can feel overwhelming. Here's how to navigate these especially challenging times.

---

## Why This Happens

### Common Causes

**Multiple conflicts can arise from:**
- Systemic issue affecting all relationships
- Your behavior pattern triggering multiple partners
- Stress affecting how you show up everywhere
- Coincidence (unrelated conflicts happening at once)

### Recognize Patterns

**Ask yourself:**
- Is there a common thread?
- Is something about me creating this?
- Are these connected or separate issues?
- What's the underlying cause?

---

## Immediate Coping

### Don't Panic

**Remember:**
- This is temporary
- Conflicts can be resolved
- You've handled hard things before
- One step at a time

### Prioritize Self-Regulation

**Before anything else:**
- Get yourself stable
- Can't resolve conflict when dysregulated
- Take care of basic needs
- Ground yourself

### Avoid Making It Worse

**Don't:**
- Lash out at everyone
- Shut down completely
- Make impulsive decisions
- Escalate multiple fronts

---

## Separating the Conflicts

### Each Relationship Is Different

**Treat separately:**
- Different issues need different approaches
- Don't conflate conflicts
- Address each on its own terms
- Avoid generalizing

### Don't Let One Bleed Into Another

**Common mistake:**
- Fighting with Partner A, taking it out on Partner B
- Emotional spillover between relationships
- Unfair to each partner
- Makes everything worse

### Create Mental Separation

**Try:**
- Processing each relationship separately
- Clear transitions between conversations
- Not carrying anger from one to another
- Treating each partner as individual

---

## Triage and Prioritization

### Assess Urgency

**Consider:**
- Which conflict is most urgent?
- Which relationship is most at risk?
- What needs immediate attention?
- What can wait?

### Don't Ignore Anyone

**Balance by:**
- Acknowledging each partner's concerns
- Letting them know you're aware and working on it
- Not neglecting one to focus on another
- Finding time for each

### Realistic Bandwidth

**Accept:**
- You can't fully resolve everything at once
- Some progress is better than none
- Multiple conversations take time
- Be patient with yourself

---

## Communication Strategies

### With Each Partner

**Be honest:**
- "I'm also having challenges with [other partner]"
- "I'm feeling overwhelmed right now"
- "I'm committed to working through this with you"
- "Can we schedule a time to talk properly?"

### About Your Limits

**Set expectations:**
- "I may need a little more time to respond"
- "I'm dealing with a lot right now"
- "I want to give this my full attention when I can"
- Without making them feel less important

### Asking for Grace

**It's okay to request:**
- Patience while you work through things
- Understanding of your situation
- Flexibility on timing
- Support even while in conflict

---

## Looking for Patterns

### Your Role

**Honestly assess:**
- Am I contributing to multiple conflicts?
- Is there something I need to change?
- Are my partners pointing to the same thing?
- What's my part in this?

### Systemic Issues

**Consider:**
- Is this about time/attention allocation?
- Are agreements not working for everyone?
- Is something about poly structure the issue?
- Do systemic changes need to happen?

### Coincidence

**Sometimes:**
- It's genuinely unrelated
- Bad timing happens
- Not everything is connected
- Don't over-analyze if it's coincidence

---

## Getting Support

### Who to Turn To

**Reach out to:**
- Friends outside the situation
- Therapist if you have one
- Community support
- Anyone not involved in the conflicts

### What Partners Can't Provide

**During conflict, partners:**
- Can't be your only support
- Are dealing with their own feelings
- May not have capacity for you
- Shouldn't be your processing partner about the other

### Professional Help

**Consider:**
- Individual therapy to process
- Relationship therapy with each partner
- Support groups
- Coaching if appropriate

---

## Working Toward Resolution

### One at a Time

**Approach:**
- Schedule conversations separately
- Give each conflict full attention
- Don't rush to resolve everything at once
- Quality resolution over speed

### Finding Common Threads

**If connected:**
- Address root cause
- Make systemic changes
- Apply learning across relationships
- Prevent future patterns

### Rebuilding

**After conflicts resolve:**
- Repair with each partner
- Reflect on what happened
- Implement changes
- Reconnect and move forward

---

## When It's Too Much

### Recognizing Overload

**Signs you're overwhelmed:**
- Can't function normally
- Every interaction feels like conflict
- Mental health suffering
- No capacity left

### Asking for Pause

**It's okay to:**
- Request temporary pause on some discussions
- Take space to recover
- Focus on stabilizing before resolving
- Prioritize your wellbeing

### Getting Help

**Seek support if:**
- You can't handle this alone
- Mental health is seriously affected
- Relationships are at real risk
- You need professional guidance

## FAQ

**Should I tell each partner I'm also in conflict with the other?**
Generally yes—honesty matters. But be thoughtful about how and when, and don't use it as excuse.

**What if multiple partners are upset about the same thing?**
That's important information. You probably need to address whatever they're pointing to.

**How do I have energy for multiple difficult conversations?**
You may not all at once. Pace yourself, take care of yourself, ask for patience.

**What if I can't resolve all the conflicts?**
Some may result in relationship changes or endings. That's painful but sometimes necessary.
