Your metamour is your partner's other partner. You didn't choose each other directly, but you're connected through someone you both care about. This unique relationship needs its own boundaries.

Here's how to set healthy boundaries with metamours—whatever your poly style.

## Understanding the Metamour Dynamic

### What Makes It Unique

**Metamour relationships are:**
- Not chosen directly by you
- Connected through shared partner
- Variable in closeness (friends to strangers)
- Subject to poly style (parallel to kitchen table)

**Challenges:**
- No default expectations
- Different from friendship or partnership
- Potential for comparison or competition
- Requires intentional navigation

### Different Poly Styles Affect This

**Kitchen Table Poly:**
- More metamour interaction expected
- More boundaries needed for that interaction
- Closer relationship dynamics

**Parallel Poly:**
- Minimal metamour interaction
- Boundaries often about maintaining separation
- Less direct relationship to manage

**Whatever your style, boundaries matter.**

## Boundaries YOU Can Set

### Direct Interaction Boundaries

**About your relationship with them:**
- How much you interact
- What you discuss
- How you communicate
- Shared activities/events

**Examples:**
- "I prefer to interact with metamours at group events but not one-on-one."
- "I'm not comfortable texting directly with my metamour—communication goes through our shared partner."
- "I'd like to get to know my metamour gradually, not be thrust into closeness."

### Information Boundaries

**What you know about them/their relationship:**
- Details about their intimacy
- Their personal life
- What they say about you
- Comparisons

**Examples:**
- "I don't want to know details about your sex life with [metamour]."
- "Please don't share what [metamour] says about me unless it's directly relevant."
- "I'd prefer not to hear comparisons between us."

### Space Boundaries

**Physical and social spaces:**
- Your home
- Shared events
- Your time with partner
- Social media

**Examples:**
- "I'd like my bedroom to be just for us."
- "I need advance notice before [metamour] comes to our home."
- "I'd prefer not to have [metamour] at my birthday dinner."

### Emotional Boundaries

**Emotional labor and processing:**
- What you'll help with
- Metamour's relationship issues
- Your role in their conflicts
- How much you're involved

**Examples:**
- "I can't be the person who processes your issues with [metamour]."
- "I don't want to mediate between you two."
- "I'd prefer to hear about your relationship with them in summary, not detail."

## Boundaries YOU Can't Set

### About Their Behavior

**You can't directly control:**
- What they do
- How they relate to your partner
- Their relationship choices
- Their communication style

**Instead:**
- Set boundaries about what you'll accept
- Communicate through shared partner when appropriate
- Accept what you can't control

### About Your Partner's Relationship

**You generally can't dictate:**
- How often they see each other
- What they do together
- How their relationship progresses
- Their agreements

**Instead:**
- Focus on your needs in your relationship
- Communicate about impacts on you
- Accept you're not part of that relationship

## Communicating Boundaries

### When to Communicate Directly with Metamour

**Direct communication works for:**
- Boundaries about your direct interaction
- Logistics you share
- Direct conflicts between you two
- Requests that don't involve your partner

**Example:**
> "Hey [metamour], I wanted to let you know I'm someone who needs more space in poly relationships. I'm not being unfriendly—I just relate better to metamours with some distance. I hope that works for you."

### When to Communicate Through Your Partner

**Through your partner works for:**
- Boundaries that affect their relationship
- Things you're uncomfortable saying directly
- When direct contact might create conflict
- Early in metamour relationships

**Example to partner:**
> "Can you let [metamour] know that I prefer not to discuss details of your relationship with them? It's not about disliking them—it's just what helps me stay secure."

### How to Frame Boundaries

**Helpful approaches:**
- "This is what works for me"
- "I function best when..."
- "For my own wellbeing, I need..."
- "This isn't personal, it's my general approach to..."

**Avoid:**
- Making it about their flaws
- Implying they've done something wrong
- Being unnecessarily harsh
- Making your partner feel caught in middle

### The Hostile Metamour

**If they're cold or antagonistic:**

### The Competitive Metamour

**If they compare or compete:**
- Don't engage in competition

## Parallel vs. Kitchen Table Boundaries

### Choosing Parallel

**If you prefer distance:**
- You're allowed to have minimal metamour relationship
- Explain to partner what you need
- Accept limitations this creates
- Find what level works

**Boundaries for parallel:**
- "I prefer not to spend time with my metamours."
- "Please don't share details about their life with me."
- "I'd like separate social events."

### Choosing Kitchen Table

**If you want closeness:**
- This requires metamour's cooperation
- You can't force closeness
- Build gradually
- Boundaries still matter

**Boundaries for kitchen table:**
- "I'd like to meet new metamours early."
- "I enjoy group activities—let's plan some."
- "I want to know about their life at a reasonable level."

### Mixed Preferences

**If you and metamour want different levels:**
- Negotiate what works for both
- May need to accept middle ground
- Partner can help bridge gap
- Some incompatibility is okay

### Escalation

**If violations continue:**
- Clearer communication needed
- May need to increase distance

No. You can be parallel (minimal contact), friendly acquaintances, or close friends. Your poly style is up to you.

Yes, this is a reasonable privacy boundary. You can decide what information about you is shared.
