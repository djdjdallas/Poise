You had the fight. Maybe it was a big blow-up, maybe a cold withdrawal, maybe a painful conversation that went wrong. Now what?

In ethical non-monogamy, conflict can feel especially loaded—there are more dynamics, more potential injuries, more complexity. But repair is just as possible, and just as important. Here's how to do it well.

## Why Repair Matters

### Conflict Is Normal

All relationships have conflict. It doesn't mean:
- You're incompatible
- The relationship is failing
- You're bad at ENM
- Something is fundamentally broken

Conflict is information and opportunity. What you do with it determines the relationship's health.

### Unrepaired Conflict Compounds

Left unaddressed, conflict:
- Creates resentment
- Erodes trust
- Builds walls
- Becomes patterns
- Eventually destroys relationships

Repair prevents accumulation.

### Repair Builds Intimacy

Successfully navigating conflict together can actually strengthen relationships:
- You learn you can survive difficulty
- You understand each other better
- Trust deepens through resolution
- You develop shared repair practices

## When to Start Repair

### Not Immediately (Usually)

Right after conflict, emotions are still activated:
- You may not be thinking clearly
- Things could escalate again
- Processing hasn't happened yet
- The nervous system needs to settle

### How to Create Space

> "I need some time before we try to talk about this again. Can we take a few hours/until tomorrow?"

> "I'm not ready to discuss this yet. I want to repair, and I want to do it when I can be thoughtful about it."

### Signs You're Ready

- Your body has calmed (not racing heart, tense muscles)
- You can think about the conflict without flooding
- You're interested in resolution, not winning
- You can consider their perspective
- You want connection more than you want to be right

## The Repair Process

### Step 1: Reconnect Before Discussing

Before diving into content, reconnect:

**Physical reconnection (if welcome):**
- Sitting together
- Gentle touch
- Eye contact
- Proximity

**Emotional reconnection:**
> "I don't like when things are hard between us. I want to work through this together."

> "I love you and I want to get back to feeling connected. Can we try?"

This establishes that you're approaching repair as partners, not adversaries.

### Step 2: Acknowledge What Happened

State what occurred without relitigating:

> "We had a fight about [topic]. Things got heated. I said some things I regret."

> "The conversation about [subject] didn't go well. I want to address the damage."

Acknowledgment shows you're both aware of what needs repair.

### Step 3: Take Responsibility (Your Part)

**Own what you did:**
- What you said that wasn't okay
- How your behavior contributed
- The impact you had

**Not:**
- "I'm sorry you felt..."
- "I wouldn't have done that if you hadn't..."
- "Sorry, but you were also wrong"

**Yes:**
> "I raised my voice and said things that were hurtful. That wasn't okay regardless of how I was feeling. I'm sorry for that."

> "I shut down and withdrew, which left you hanging. I know that's hard for you and I regret responding that way."

### Step 4: Validate Their Experience

Acknowledge how they felt without defending yourself:

> "I can see that what I said really hurt you. That makes sense—those were harsh words."

> "You felt dismissed and unheard. I understand why, given how I responded."

Validation doesn't mean agreeing you were entirely wrong. It means acknowledging their emotional reality.

### Step 5: Listen to Their Side

Give them space to share:
- Without interrupting
- Without getting defensive
- Without planning your rebuttal
- With genuine curiosity

**Prompts:**
> "How are you feeling about what happened?"
> "What did you need from me that you didn't get?"
> "Is there more you need me to understand?"

### Step 6: Discuss What Happened (If Needed)

Sometimes understanding the content helps prevent recurrence:

> "I want to understand where we got off track. Can we talk about what happened without getting back into the conflict?"

**Focus on:**
- What triggered the escalation
- Where communication broke down
- What you each were trying to say
- What needs weren't getting met

**Avoid:**
- Determining who was "right"
- Proving your point
- Winning the original argument

### Step 7: Identify What Would Help Going Forward

**Discuss:**
- What could have gone differently?
- What do you each need in future conflicts?
- Are there agreements to revisit?
- What will you try next time?

**Example:**
> "I realize I need to take a break before I get to the point of yelling. Can we agree that either of us can call a pause when things are escalating?"

### Step 8: Reconnect and Close

End the repair intentionally:

> "I'm glad we talked about this. I feel closer to you now."

> "Thank you for being willing to work through this with me. I love you."

Some couples have rituals: a hug, a shared activity, a physical reconnection.

## Types of Repair Conversations

### After a Heated Fight

When things got loud, angry, or hurtful:
- Focus on the damage done
- Acknowledge specific harmful words/actions
- Work on de-escalation agreements for future

### After a Cold Conflict

When one or both withdrew, shut down, or went silent:
- Acknowledge the disconnection
- Explore what drove the withdrawal
- Discuss how to stay present in conflict

### After a Boundary Violation

When something was crossed:
- Take clear responsibility
- Understand the impact
- Recommit to the boundary
- Discuss prevention

### After a Values Clash

When you disagreed on something fundamental:
- Acknowledge the disagreement
- Find where you do align
- Determine if this is a dealbreaker or difference to navigate
- Agree on how to handle the ongoing difference

## ENM-Specific Repair

### When the Conflict Involves a Metamour

If your fight was about your partner's other relationship:

**Don't:**
- Make demands about that relationship as "repair"
- Use the repair to relitigate the original issue
- Require changes to their other relationship

**Do:**
- Focus on what you need from your partner
- Acknowledge your feelings without blaming the metamour
- Repair your relationship separately from their other one

### When the Conflict Affects Multiple Relationships

If what happened touched multiple partners:

**Consider:**
- Who needs direct repair from you?
- What's yours to repair vs. your partner's?
- Should repairs happen separately or together?

### When It's About ENM Itself

If you're fighting about polyamory, boundaries, or structure:

**The repair:**
- Acknowledge where you each stand
- Determine if there's genuine incompatibility
- Find what you can agree on
- Accept that some differences may persist

## When Repair Is Hard

### If They Won't Engage

If your partner isn't ready or willing:
- Give them time (but set reasonable limits)
- Express your desire for repair clearly
- Ask what they need to be ready
- Recognize you can't force it

### If It Keeps Happening

If you're repairing the same conflict repeatedly:
- The underlying issue isn't being addressed
- You may need outside help (therapist, mediator)
- Consider if this is a compatibility issue
- Look at patterns, not just incidents

### If Trust Is Damaged

For serious breaches:
- Repair takes longer
- Actions matter more than words
- Trust rebuilds through consistent behavior
- Some damage requires professional help

### If You Can't Forgive

If you're stuck in resentment:
- Consider what you need to let go
- Therapy can help process
- Recognize that unforgiveness hurts you too
- Some things may be unforgivable—that's information

> "I want to own my part in what happened. I [specific behavior] and I can see how that [impact]. I'm sorry, and I'm committed to doing better."

### Asking for Repair

### Closing Repair

> "I appreciate you being willing to have this conversation. I feel like we understand each other better now. I love you."

## Building a Repair Culture

### Regular Check-Ins

Don't wait for conflict to communicate:
- Weekly or bi-weekly relationship check-ins
- Addressing small issues before they grow
- Normalizing feedback and discussion

### Repair Agreements

Establish how you'll handle repair:
- Time limits on silence after conflict
- Agreements about who initiates
- Safe words for de-escalation
- Commitment to not going to bed angry (or modified version)

### Celebrate Repair

When you successfully navigate conflict:
- Acknowledge it
- Note what worked
- Feel the strengthened connection

## FAQ

**How long should I wait before trying to repair?**
Long enough to be calm, not so long that distance solidifies. Hours to a day is typical; longer gaps risk resentment.

**What if they won't apologize?**
You can repair your part regardless of their apology. But ongoing refusal to take responsibility is concerning.

**Can some conflicts not be repaired?**
Yes. Fundamental incompatibilities, repeated betrayals, or unwillingness to engage may make repair impossible.

**Should we always process conflict together?**
Not necessarily. Some individual processing helps. But relationship repair requires shared conversation.
