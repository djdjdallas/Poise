## FAQ

**Isn't scheduling relationships unromantic?**
No—it's practical and shows care. Scheduled attention still counts. Unscheduled good intentions often become neglect.

**How detailed should the schedule be?**
Detailed enough to ensure maintenance happens. Not so detailed it becomes oppressive. Find your balance.

**What if my schedule can't accommodate all partners' needs?**
That's important information. Either adjust commitments, have honest conversations about capacity, or recognize you may be overextended.

**How do I handle schedule conflicts between partners?**
Rotation, flexibility, and communication. No partner should consistently lose. Fair doesn't mean identical.
