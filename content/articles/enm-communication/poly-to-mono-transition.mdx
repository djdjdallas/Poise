## Why People Choose Monogamy After Poly

### Valid Reasons to Close

**Life circumstances:**
- Not enough time/energy for multiple relationships
- Career demands
- Parenting needs
- Health changes
- Moving to area with no poly community

**Relationship evolution:**
- Want to deepen with one person
- Found someone you want exclusivity with
- Current relationship needs full focus
- Ready for different life phase

**Personal realization:**
- Polyamory isn't for you
- Tried it, learned about yourself
- Prefer monogamy fundamentally
- Emotional bandwidth limits

### What It's Not

**This isn't:**
- Admitting poly "doesn't work"
- Saying monogamy is "better"
- Failure of any kind
- Judgment on others who stay poly

**It's simply:**
- Choosing what fits your life now
- Evolving as a person
- Honoring your needs
- Making intentional choices

## Closing a Relationship with a Partner

### The Conversation

**If you want monogamy with your current partner:**

> "I've been doing a lot of thinking about what I need, and I'm realizing I want to focus entirely on us. I want to talk about what moving toward monogamy could look like for us."

**Be clear about:**
- This is what you need
- You're not demanding, you're sharing
- You want to explore this together
- Their feelings matter too

### When You Don't Agree

**If one wants mono and one wants poly:**
- This is a fundamental incompatibility
- Neither is wrong
- May require difficult choices
- Compromise rarely works long-term

**Options:**
- One partner shifts (only if genuinely willing)
- Relationship ends
- Finding middle ground (rarely sustainable)

### Timeline for Closing

**If you agree to close:**
- Don't demand immediate action
- Allow time for existing relationships
- Gradual transition is kinder
- Set clear milestones

**Example timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Conversations with other partners
- Month 1-3: Wind down existing relationships
- Month 3+: Fully closed
- Adjust based on circumstances

---

## Ending Other Relationships

### Having the Conversation

**With other partners:**
> "I need to share something difficult. [Partner] and I have decided to close our relationship. This means I need to end our romantic relationship. This isn't about you—it's about changes I need in my life."

**Be honest about:**
- Why you're closing
- That you value what you had
- The timeline
- Whether friendship is possible

### Different Situations

**If it was casual:**
- Clear communication still matters
- Gratitude for the connection
- Clean ending

**If it was serious:**
- More conversation needed
- Allow for their feelings
- May require multiple talks
- Consider their transition needs too

**If they're in love with you:**
- This will hurt
- Be compassionate but clear
- Don't give false hope
- Allow space for grief

### Your Own Grief

**Expect to feel:**
- Sadness about ending connections
- Guilt about hurting others
- Relief mixed with loss
- Questioning your decision

**This is normal.** Choosing monogamy doesn't mean you didn't value those relationships.

## Entering Monogamy with Intention

### Not "Default" Monogamy

**Choose monogamy actively:**
- Know why you're choosing this
- What does monogamy mean to you?
- What boundaries does it include?
- What are the expectations?

**Avoid:**
- Assuming it's "normal" so no discussion needed
- Unspoken expectations
- Resentment from either side
- Treating it as restriction vs. choice

### Defining Your Monogamy

**Questions to discuss:**
- What counts as "cheating"?
- Flirting—okay or not?
- Emotional intimacy with others?
- Porn, camming, etc.?
- What if feelings develop for someone else?

### Carrying Poly Skills Forward

**You've learned:**
- Communication skills
- How to articulate needs
- Emotional processing
- Handling jealousy
- Relationship intentionality

**These serve monogamy too.** Don't lose what you've learned.

## When Starting Fresh

### Dating as Formerly Poly

**Disclosure questions:**
- Do you tell new partners about your poly past?
- When do you bring it up?
- How do you frame it?

**Our take:**
- You don't owe your dating history
- If it's relevant, share when comfortable
- Frame it positively (not as failure)
- Be clear about your current desires

### Finding Compatible Partners

**If seeking monogamous partners:**
- Be clear in your profiles
- State what you're looking for
- Don't hide your past, but don't lead with it
- Screen for shared values

### Handling Questions

**If they ask about your poly past:**
> "I explored polyamory for a few years. It taught me a lot about myself and relationships. Now I know I want monogamy, and I'm looking for someone who wants that too."

## Processing the Transition

## FAQ

**Is wanting monogamy after poly a sign I was never "really" poly?**
No. You can genuinely be poly for a period and genuinely want monogamy later. People and needs change.

**How do I tell my poly friends I'm going mono?**
Honestly and without apology. Real friends will support your choices even if they'd choose differently.

**My partner wants to close but I don't. What are my options?**
You can close (if you genuinely can accept it), stay open unilaterally (rarely works), or end the relationship. There's no magic compromise.

**Will mono feel restrictive after poly?**
It might at first. The adjustment takes time. Focus on what you're gaining, not just what you're giving up.
