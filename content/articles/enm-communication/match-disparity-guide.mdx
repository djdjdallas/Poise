One of the most common and painful experiences in ENM: one partner's inbox is full while the other's is empty.

Match disparity is real, and it hurts. Here's how to navigate it.

---

## The Reality

### This Is Common

Match disparity happens frequently:
- Women often receive more matches
- Men often struggle more on apps
- Various factors affect who gets attention
- It rarely feels "fair"

### Why It Happens

**Platform dynamics:**
- Gender ratios on dating apps
- How algorithms work
- What profiles get visibility
- Who initiates on which platforms

**Social factors:**
- Different experiences by gender
- Physical attractiveness standards
- Communication styles
- What different people seek

**Individual factors:**
- Profile quality
- Photos
- Communication skills
- What you're seeking

## The Partner Getting Fewer Matches

### What You Might Feel

- Jealousy of their success
- Inadequacy ("What's wrong with me?")
- Resentment ("This isn't fair")
- Discouragement ("Why bother?")
- Loneliness while they date

All of these feelings are valid. Acknowledging them is the first step.

### What Not to Do

**Don't make it their problem:**
- Asking them to stop dating
- Making them feel guilty for success
- Punishing them for your struggles
- Using your pain as a veto

**Don't spiral into self-destruction:**
- Believing you're unlovable
- Giving up entirely
- Lowering standards desperately
- Comparing yourself constantly

### What to Do Instead

**Acknowledge the feeling:**
> "I'm struggling with feeling left behind. I know it's not your fault, but I'm hurting."

**Ask for support:**
> "I could use some reassurance right now. Can you remind me why you chose me?"

**Focus on what you can control:**
- Improving your profile
- Trying different platforms
- Meeting people other ways
- Working on yourself

**Reframe success:**
- Quality over quantity
- Your timeline, not comparison
- Each person's journey is different
- Matches ≠ meaningful connections

## The Partner Getting More Matches

### What You Might Feel

- Guilt about your success
- Frustration ("I shouldn't have to hold back")
- Confusion about how to help
- Desire to fix their situation
- Joy about connections, complicated by their pain

### What Not to Do

**Don't diminish your success:**
- Hiding matches or dates
- Downplaying your experiences
- Not enjoying your connections fully
- Putting your dating life on hold

**Don't dismiss their feelings:**
- "You're overreacting"
- "Just be patient"
- "It's not that bad"

### What to Do Instead

**Acknowledge and validate:**
> "I can see this is really hard. The disparity isn't fair, and I understand why it hurts."

**Offer reassurance:**
> "These matches don't change how I feel about you. You're still my person."

**Provide support:**
> "Is there anything I can do to help? I could review your profile with you, or just listen if you need to vent."

**Stay connected:**
- Make sure quality time doesn't disappear
- Show them they're still a priority
- Don't let your dating life eclipse them
- Be present when you're together

## Having the Conversation

### When It Hurts

**The struggling partner:**
> "I need to talk about how the match disparity is affecting me. I'm not asking you to stop dating, but I'm struggling and I need support."

**The successful partner:**
> "I've noticed things are harder for you on the apps. I want to check in—how are you doing? What do you need from me?"

### What to Discuss

**The feelings:**
- What specifically hurts?
- What triggers are there?
- What would help?

**The practical:**
- Any adjustments needed?
- How to communicate during rough patches?
- What support looks like?

**The boundaries:**
- What's reasonable to ask?
- What's not fair to ask?
- Where's the line between support and restriction?

### Sample Dialogue

**Partner A:** "I've had three dates this week and I know you haven't had any. How are you doing with that?"

**Partner B:** "Honestly, it's hard. I'm happy for you, but I also feel left behind. I keep wondering what's wrong with me."

**Partner A:** "Nothing's wrong with you. The apps are just harder for some people. What would help right now?"

**Partner B:** "I think I just need to know I'm still important to you. And maybe we could have a really good date night this week?"

**Partner A:** "Absolutely. You're my priority. Let's plan something special."

## When It's Really Hard

### If Disparity Persists Long-Term

Sometimes the gap doesn't close. Options:
- Accept the imbalance as a feature of your situation
- Adjust expectations and how you date
- Find other ways to meet the struggling partner's needs
- Consider whether ENM is working for both of you

### If Resentment Builds

Warning signs:
- Growing anger about the situation
- Punishing the successful partner
- Withdrawing from the relationship
- Inability to discuss it productively

**What to do:**
- Couples counseling
- Honest conversation about sustainability
- Possible pause on dating to reconnect
- Assessment of whether to continue ENM

## Reframing the Situation

### Matches Aren't the Metric

What actually matters:
- Meaningful connections
- Quality of relationships
- Overall relationship satisfaction
- Growth and fulfillment

### Different Timelines

Some people find connections quickly; others take longer. Neither is wrong. Your journey is your own.

### The Comparison Trap

Comparing to your partner (or to others) is a losing game:
- Their journey isn't yours
- Different factors affect each person
- Your worth isn't measured by matches
