STI conversations are non-negotiable in ethical non-monogamy—but that doesn't make them less awkward. Many people avoid these talks because they don't know how to start or worry about killing the mood.

This guide helps you normalize STI conversations and make them a standard, low-drama part of your dating life.

## Why This Conversation Matters

### The ENM Context

In non-monogamy:
- More partners = more potential exposure points
- Your partners' partners' health affects you
- Chains of connection multiply risk
- Everyone deserves informed consent about risk

### What Silence Creates

Avoiding the conversation leads to:
- Assuming without knowing
- Risk you didn't consent to
- Potential exposure to infections
- Broken trust when issues emerge
- Stigma winning over health

### The Goal

Make STI conversations:
- Normal, not shameful
- Practical, not dramatic
- Informative, not interrogative
- Ongoing, not one-time

---

## When to Have This Conversation

### Before Sex

The basic rule: before any sexual contact that could transmit infections. This includes:
- Oral sex
- Penetrative sex
- Any genital contact
- Sharing toys

### How Early?

Options:
- **In the profile:** "I test regularly and expect the same"
- **Early messaging:** Before meeting in person
- **First date:** If things are heading physical
- **Before clothes come off:** Latest acceptable moment

Earlier is better—it screens for compatibility and avoids awkward last-minute reveals.

## How to Start the Conversation

### Normalizing It

Frame it as standard practice:
> "Before we go further, I want to talk about sexual health. It's something I do with everyone—just part of how I practice ENM."

### Making It Mutual

Offer your info first:
> "I got tested last month—everything came back negative. I test every three months since I have multiple partners. What's your testing situation?"

### Low-Pressure Phrasing

Avoid making it feel like an interrogation:
> "Can we do the STI check-in? I know it's not sexy but it's important to me."

> "I like to talk about safer sex before we get physical. What works for you in terms of barriers and testing?"

## What to Actually Discuss

### The Essential Questions

1. **When were you last tested?**
2. **What were you tested for?** (Different tests cover different things)
3. **What were the results?**
4. **Have you had new partners since?**
5. **What barriers do you use?**
6. **What are your expectations/agreements?**

### Tests to Know About

| Infection | How it's tested | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| HIV | Blood test | Get tested 2-4 weeks after potential exposure |
| Chlamydia | Urine or swab | Very common, often asymptomatic |
| Gonorrhea | Urine or swab | Can infect throat too—ask for oral swab if needed |
| Syphilis | Blood test | On the rise in many areas |
| Herpes | Blood test or swab | Many people have it; rarely included in standard panels |
| HPV | Pap smear (cervical) | No standard test for people without cervixes |

### What "Full Panel" Often Misses

Standard STI panels usually don't include:
- Herpes (unless you specifically ask)
- HPV
- Oral gonorrhea/chlamydia

Ask specifically for what you want tested.

### Discussing Barriers

Topics to cover:
- Condoms for penetration (always? situationally?)
- Barriers for oral sex
- Gloves for manual sex
- Dental dams
- What's negotiable vs. non-negotiable

## Handling Different Scenarios

### If They Have Something

STIs are common. If someone discloses:
- Thank them for telling you
- Ask questions (transmission, management, precautions)
- Research before deciding
- Don't shame or panic

Having an STI doesn't make someone a bad partner—it makes them honest.

### If They Haven't Been Tested Recently

Options:
- Wait until they get tested
- Use barriers and accept some risk
- Decide it's not compatible with your practices

You're allowed to have standards.

### If They Refuse to Discuss

Major red flag. Someone who won't have this conversation:
- Isn't practicing ethical non-monogamy
- Doesn't respect your health
- Probably isn't having these talks with others either

### If You Have Something to Disclose

Be direct:
> "I have herpes. I take suppressive medication and use barriers, which reduces transmission risk significantly. I wanted you to know before we decide how to proceed."

You don't need to disclose your life history—just current relevant status.

## Ongoing Conversations

### It's Not a One-Time Talk

STI conversations should happen:
- Before initial intimacy
- After new partners join your network
- When testing status changes
- If agreements change
- Regularly (quarterly check-ins work well)

### With Established Partners

Even in long-term relationships:
- Update after testing
- Discuss when you add new partners
- Revisit if anyone's risk profile changes
- Don't assume—communicate

### Network Conversations

In poly networks:
- You may need info about metamours' practices
- Discuss what info gets shared and how
- Create agreements about testing frequency
- Handle exposures as a team

---

## Making It Less Awkward

### Reframe It

This conversation is:
- Care for yourself and each other
- Sexy because it shows maturity
- A green flag, not a red flag
- Normal adult behavior

### Practice the Scripts

The more you do it, the easier it gets:
- Start with friends (normalize the language)
- Practice in the mirror
- Have your standard opener ready
- It becomes routine with repetition

### Timing Tips

- Not in the heat of the moment
- When you're both clothed and clear-headed
- Before alcohol/substances impair judgment
- When there's time to discuss without pressure

## Resources

### Where to Get Tested

- Primary care doctor
- Planned Parenthood
- Sexual health clinics
