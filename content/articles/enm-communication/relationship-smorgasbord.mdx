Traditional relationship models come as packages: "dating" includes these things, "partnership" includes those. But what if you could build relationships à la carte?

The relationship smorgasbord is a tool for doing exactly that.

---

## What Is the Relationship Smorgasbord?

### The Concept

The smorgasbord (sometimes called "relationship menu") breaks relationships into component parts that can be mixed and matched:
- What elements do you want in this relationship?
- What elements does your partner want?
- What can you build together?

Instead of saying "let's be partners" (which assumes a lot), you discuss specific elements.

### Origin

Created by non-monogamy communities, the smorgasbord helps people design relationships intentionally rather than inheriting assumptions.

### Why It's Useful

- Makes implicit expectations explicit
- Allows for truly custom relationships
- Prevents assumption mismatches
- Works for any relationship type

## How to Use the Smorgasbord

### Step 1: Individual Reflection

Before discussing with a partner, reflect on your own wants:
- What elements are essential for you?
- What elements are nice-to-have?
- What elements do you not want?
- What are you flexible about?

### Step 2: Share and Compare

Share your reflections:
- Where do you overlap?
- Where do you differ?
- What's negotiable vs. non-negotiable?
- Where are you both flexible?

### Step 3: Design Together

Build your unique relationship:
- Include elements you both want
- Discuss elements one wants, the other doesn't
- Find creative solutions for mismatches
- Accept differences that can't be bridged

### Step 4: Revisit and Adjust

The smorgasbord isn't a one-time exercise:
- Check in periodically
- Acknowledge changing desires
- Renegotiate as needed
- Celebrate what's working

## Example Smorgasbord Conversations

### Example 1: New Dating Relationship

**You:** "I'd love to figure out what we're building together. Want to go through what each of us is looking for?"

**Emotional intimacy:** Both want medium-high
**Physical intimacy:** Both want, at their own pace
**Romantic gestures:** You want more than they do—discuss
**Domestic:** Neither looking for that now
**Social:** Meet friends eventually, no rush
**Time:** Once a week works for both

**Outcome:** Clear expectations from the start.

### Example 2: Existing Partnership Renegotiation

**You:** "I've been thinking about what's working and what's not. Can we talk through the different areas of our relationship?"

**Domestic:** Living together works
**Finances:** Want to revisit how they're shared
**Time:** Need more independent time
**Social:** Would like more couple socializing

**Outcome:** Targeted adjustments, not vague complaints.

### Example 3: Non-Traditional Relationship

**You:** "I really value our connection and want to define what it is for us, outside of standard labels."

**Emotional intimacy:** Very high
**Physical intimacy:** Non-sexual touch only
**Romantic gestures:** Some, but not traditional "dating"
**Partnership:** Some domestic sharing when together
**Labels:** "Queer platonic partners" or something custom

**Outcome:** A relationship that fits instead of being forced into categories.

## Navigating Mismatches

### When Wants Don't Align

**Option 1: Compromise**
- Find middle ground
- Both give a little
- Revisit later

**Option 2: Creative Solutions**
- Get that need met elsewhere
- Find alternative expressions
- Build something neither initially imagined

**Option 3: Accept Incompatibility**
- Some mismatches are fundamental
- Better to know than pretend
- Can still have relationship, just different

### Common Mismatch Examples

**Different romance needs:**
> "You want more romantic gestures than I naturally give. Can we talk about what specifically would feel good for you, and I'll work on showing up that way?"

**Different time needs:**
> "I need more solo time than you do. Can we find a balance where you get enough connection and I get enough space?"

**Different domestic visions:**
> "I'm not interested in cohabitation, but I do want a deeply committed partnership. What would that look like for you?"

## The Smorgasbord and ENM

### Multiple Relationships

The smorgasbord is especially useful in ENM:
- Each relationship can be different
- Not everything comes from one person
- Allows for specialization

**Example:**
- Partner A: Deep emotional intimacy, some physical, no domestic
- Partner B: High physical intimacy, lower emotional depth
- Partner C: Partnership with domestic sharing
- Close friend: Emotional intimacy without romance

### Addressing Comparison

The smorgasbord helps avoid unhelpful comparison:
- Each relationship is its own design
- Different isn't less
- Comparison misses the point

## Common Questions

### "Isn't this unromantic?"

Clarity and intentionality can be deeply romantic. Building something together that actually fits both people is more romantic than hoping assumptions match.

### "Do I have to cover every category?"

No. Use what's useful, ignore what's not. The categories are tools, not requirements.

### "What if my needs change?"

That's expected. The smorgasbord is a living document, not a binding contract. Revisit it as you evolve.

### "Can I use this for friendships?"

Absolutely. The smorgasbord works for any relationship where clarifying expectations would help.
