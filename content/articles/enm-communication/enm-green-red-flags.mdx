Not everything labeled "ethical non-monogamy" is actually ethical. Some people use ENM as cover for cheating, manipulation, or one-sided arrangements that harm partners.

Here's how to distinguish genuine ENM from the toxic alternatives.

---

## What Makes Non-Monogamy "Ethical"

### The Core Requirements

For non-monogamy to be ethical, it needs:
- **Full informed consent** from everyone affected
- **Honesty** about the situation
- **Respect** for all parties involved
- **Agency** for everyone to make their own choices

If any of these are missing, it's not ENM—it's just non-monogamy (at best) or cheating/manipulation (at worst).

## 10 Green Flags of Genuine ENM

### 1. Everyone Affected Knows and Consents

**What it looks like:**
- Partners are aware of other relationships
- New people know about existing partners
- Nobody is being kept secret
- Consent is ongoing, not one-time

**Why it matters:**
Without informed consent, there's no "ethical" in ethical non-monogamy.

### 2. Rules Apply Equally

**What it looks like:**
- Both/all partners have similar freedoms
- Nobody has more dating privileges than others
- Restrictions are mutual, not one-sided
- Everyone agreed to the structure

**Why it matters:**
One-sided arrangements often benefit one person while restricting another.

### 3. Partners Speak Positively About Each Other

**What it looks like:**
- They describe partners with respect
- Acknowledge metamours exist without resentment
- Don't badmouth other relationships
- Show genuine care for all partners

**Why it matters:**
How they talk about partners predicts how they'll treat you.

### 4. They Communicate Proactively

**What it looks like:**
- Share relevant information without being asked
- Discuss changes before they happen
- Check in regularly about how things are going
- Don't hide important details

**Why it matters:**
Good ENM requires active communication, not secrets.

### 5. Boundaries Are Respected

**What it looks like:**
- No means no, without negotiation
- They honor agreements they've made
- Boundaries evolve through conversation, not violation
- They respect your autonomy

**Why it matters:**
Boundary respect in small things predicts respect in big things.

### 6. New Relationships Have a Path Forward

**What it looks like:**
- You can have real relationship, not just sex
- Potential for emotional connection exists
- You're not permanently "less than"
- Growth is possible

**Why it matters:**
Ethical means treating people as people, not as accessories.

### 7. They've Done the Work

**What it looks like:**
- Read books, had conversations
- Can articulate their structure
- Understand common ENM concepts
- Continue learning and growing

**Why it matters:**
ENM without education often fails or harms people.

### 8. Jealousy Is Acknowledged, Not Weaponized

**What it looks like:**
- They admit when they feel jealous
- Work through feelings rather than projecting
- Don't use jealousy to control others
- Take responsibility for their emotions

**Why it matters:**
Jealousy is normal; using it to manipulate isn't.

### 9. All Partners Have Voice in Decisions

**What it looks like:**
- Rules that affect you were negotiated with you
- You can renegotiate things that aren't working
- Your needs are considered, not just theirs
- Power is reasonably balanced

**Why it matters:**
One-sided rule-making isn't ethical.

### 10. The Relationship Could Work Long-Term

**What it looks like:**
- Structure is sustainable
- Not built on someone sacrificing indefinitely
- Everyone's needs can reasonably be met
- There's a path to stability

**Why it matters:**
Sustainable structures indicate genuine ethical intent.

## 10 Red Flags That It's Not Actually ENM

### 1. "My Partner Doesn't Know"

**What it looks like:**
- Secretive about partner
- "It's complicated" without explanation
- Asks you to hide your existence
- Only available at odd times

**Why it's a problem:**
This isn't ENM—it's cheating. Run.

### 2. Rules Only Restrict One Person

**What it looks like:**
- They can date, but partner can't
- One Penis Policy (she can see women, not men)
- They have veto power over you but not vice versa
- Double standards everywhere

**Why it's a problem:**
One-sided arrangements often mask insecurity or control.

### 3. You're Asked to Be a Secret

**What it looks like:**
- Can't acknowledge you publicly
- Partner doesn't know about you
- You're hidden on social media
- Can't be mentioned to friends

**Why it's a problem:**
If you're a secret, you're not in an ethical relationship.

### 4. They Trash Talk Partners

**What it looks like:**
- Constant complaints about partner
- Disparaging remarks about metamours
- Playing you against others
- Creating drama between relationships

**Why it's a problem:**
They'll talk about you this way to others.

### 5. Consent Was Coerced

**What it looks like:**
- Partner agreed under pressure
- "This or we break up" ultimatums
- Consent came during crisis
- One person clearly unhappy with arrangement

**Why it's a problem:**
Coerced consent isn't consent.

### 6. You're Treated as Less-Than

**What it looks like:**
- Called "secondary" pejoratively
- Permanent limits on relationship potential
- Your needs always come last
- Disposable when inconvenient

**Why it's a problem:**
Ethical means treating people as full humans.

### 7. Rules Change Without Discussion

**What it looks like:**
- New restrictions appear suddenly
- Agreements made aren't kept
- Goalposts constantly move
- Your input isn't sought

**Why it's a problem:**
Unilateral rule changes violate consent.

### 8. They Avoid Accountability

**What it looks like:**
- Deflect when called out
- Blame others for their choices
- Never apologize meaningfully
- Don't change after harm

**Why it's a problem:**
Without accountability, harm repeats.

### 9. "Ethical" Is Just a Label

**What it looks like:**
- Say they're ENM but don't act like it
- Use terminology without understanding
- Don't actually follow ENM principles
- It's branding, not practice

**Why it's a problem:**
Labels without substance are manipulation.

### 10. Your Gut Says Something's Wrong

**What it looks like:**
- Can't articulate it but feel uneasy
- Things don't quite add up
- Questions get deflected
- Explanations don't satisfy

**Why it's a problem:**
Intuition often catches what logic misses.

## Questions to Ask to Find Out

### About Their Partners

> "Does your partner know you're on here? Are they supportive?"

> "How do your partners feel about you dating?"

> "Could I meet your partner at some point, or is that not part of how you structure things?"

### About Structure

> "What does your ENM setup look like?"

> "Do you and your partners have similar freedoms?"

> "What rules or agreements do you have that would affect me?"

### About You

> "What kind of relationship could this become?"

> "Would I have input on decisions that affect me?"

> "What happens if I develop deeper feelings?"

## When You Discover It's Not ENM

### If You're Just Talking

End the conversation:
> "Based on what you've described, this isn't something I can be part of. I only engage in genuinely ethical non-monogamy."

### If You're Already Involved

You have choices:
- End the connection
- Ask them to change (and decide if you believe they will)
- Accept the situation (but stop calling it ENM)

### The Hard Truth

You can't make someone's non-monogamy ethical. You can only decide whether to participate in what they're offering.

---

## Protecting Yourself

### Early Vetting

Ask questions before investing:
- About partners and their awareness
- About structure and rules
- About what this could become

### Trust Patterns, Not Promises

Watch:
- How they treat partners you can observe
- Whether actions match words
- How they handle small tests of honesty

### Know Your Limits

Decide in advance:
- What red flags you won't tolerate
- When you'll walk away
- What ethical means to you
