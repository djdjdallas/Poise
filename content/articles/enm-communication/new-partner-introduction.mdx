When you have multiple partners, the question of introduction eventually comes up. Meeting a metamour can be awkward, exciting, anxiety-inducing, or all three. Here's how to handle introductions well.

---

## Whether to Introduce

### Reasons to Introduce

**Introduction makes sense when:**
- Relationships are becoming significant
- Practical coordination is needed
- Both parties want to meet
- It would help everyone feel comfortable
- Long-term integration is likely

### Reasons to Wait

**Hold off if:**
- Relationships are very new/uncertain
- Either party isn't ready
- There's active conflict to resolve first
- Timing isn't right
- No practical reason yet

### Not Always Necessary

**Introduction isn't mandatory:**
- Some people prefer parallel poly
- Meeting isn't required for ENM to work
- Preferences vary
- Respect what works for everyone

---

## Timing the Introduction

### Too Soon

**Risks of rushing:**
- Pressure on new relationship
- Investment before things are solid
- Awkwardness if things don't work out
- Overwhelming the new person

### Too Late

**Risks of waiting too long:**
- Builds up to feel like big deal
- Existing partner may feel excluded
- Creates mystery/anxiety
- Harder the longer you wait

### Right Timing

**Consider meeting when:**
- New relationship has established itself
- Both parties feel ready
- Practical reasons arise
- Natural opportunities present

## FAQ

**Do metamours have to meet?**
No. Some poly structures don't involve metamour relationships. It's a preference, not requirement.

**When is the right time to introduce partners?**
When both are ready, the new relationship has some stability, and there's desire or reason to meet.

**What if one partner doesn't want to meet?**
Respect their preference. Explore why, but don't force. Parallel poly is valid.

**What if they become friends?**
Wonderful! What if they don't? Also fine. The goal is workable relationships, not mandated friendship.
