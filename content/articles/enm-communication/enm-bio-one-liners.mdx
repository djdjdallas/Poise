Your dating bio has limited space, and you need to communicate that you're ethically non-monogamous without writing an essay. The right one-liner can do the job—filtering for compatibility while staying approachable.

Here are effective ways to explain ENM in a single sentence, organized by style and situation.

---

## Why Your Bio Matters

### What a Good ENM Line Does

- Filters out incompatible matches early
- Signals openness to the right people
- Sets expectations before matching
- Shows you're thoughtful about it

### What to Avoid

- Being preachy or lecture-y
- Assuming everyone knows the terms
- Being so vague people don't understand
- Sounding defensive

## Direct and Clear One-Liners

For when you want no ambiguity:

> "Ethically non-monogamous. I have a partner and we both date openly."

> "Polyamorous with one partner. Looking for additional meaningful connections."

> "ENM—I practice ethical non-monogamy and I'm upfront about it."

> "Non-monogamous and not looking to change that."

> "Happily partnered and ethically open."

---

## Warm and Approachable

For a friendlier tone:

> "Happily partnered, ethically open, genuinely curious about new connections."

> "Believer in love that doesn't have to be limited—ethically non-monogamous."

> "Non-monogamous by choice, still here for real connection and good conversation."

> "My partner knows I'm here, and they're supportive. Let's chat!"

> "Open relationship, open heart, open to meeting you."

---

## Brief and Efficient

When space is really limited:

> "ENM with a nesting partner."

> "Poly. Have partners. Looking for more."

> "Ethically non-monogamous—ask me about it."

> "Non-monogamous. Yes, my partner knows."

> "Open relationship—transparency matters to me."

---

## For Specific Situations

### If You're Solo Poly

> "Solo poly—I don't have a primary partner and I'm not looking for one."

> "Relationship anarchist. I design connections based on what works, not what's expected."

> "Non-monogamous without a nesting partner—I value autonomy in all my relationships."

### If You're a Couple

> "Partnered couple exploring together. We date as a pair and/or individually."

> "Married and open—both of us are on here and we communicate about everything."

> "We're a couple who also dates separately. Feel free to match with either/both of us."

### If You're New to ENM

> "Newly exploring ethical non-monogamy. Still learning, but committed to doing it right."

> "Recently opened our relationship—doing lots of reading and communicating."

> "New to ENM. Looking for patient, kind humans to connect with."

### If You Have a Specific Structure

> "Hierarchical poly—I have a primary partner and room for additional connections."

> "Non-hierarchical polyamorist. I don't rank my relationships."

> "Open for physical connections, not seeking additional romantic partners."

---

## Addressing Common Concerns

### "Yes, My Partner Knows"

> "Non-monogamous, and yes—my partner not only knows, they're supportive."

> "Before you ask: my partner knows, this is ethical, and I'm happy to discuss how it works."

> "ENM means everyone consents—including my partner, who knows I'm here."

### "This Isn't Casual"

> "Polyamorous and looking for meaningful connections, not just hookups."

> "Non-monogamous doesn't mean noncommittal. I'm here for real relationships."

> "ENM and still seeking depth, not just breadth."

### "I'm Upfront About It"

> "I lead with transparency—that includes telling you I'm non-monogamous."

> "Honesty first: I'm ethically non-monogamous and happy to explain what that means."

## What to Add After Your One-Liner

Your ENM line is just part of the bio. Also include:

- **What you're looking for** (relationship type, connection style)
- **Your interests** (conversation starters)
- **Your personality** (humor, warmth, directness)
- **What you offer** (communication style, availability)

### Example Full Bio

> "Ethically non-monogamous with a nesting partner. Looking for genuine connection and good conversation. I'm into hiking, cooking elaborate meals, and deep talks about weird topics. Excellent at texting back and planning actual dates."

## Platform-Specific Tips

### Feeld

Feeld users expect ENM. You can be brief:
> "Partnered and open. Ask me anything."

Your desires/profile will communicate more.

### Hinge/Bumble/Tinder

More explanation helps since these are general apps:
> "Ethically non-monogamous—I have a partner and we both date openly with full knowledge and consent. Happy to answer questions!"

### OkCupid

Use the built-in relationship style fields, then add context:
> "My profile says non-monogamous—that means I practice polyamory with transparency and communication at the center."

## Common Mistakes

### Too Defensive

**Bad:** "Yes I'm non-monogamous, no I'm not cheating, no I don't need your judgment"

Better to be matter-of-fact than defensive.

### Too Vague

**Bad:** "Open to connections"

This doesn't clearly communicate ENM.

### Too Much Detail

**Bad:** "I practice hierarchical polyamory with prescriptive elements..."

Save the nuances for conversation.

### Preachy

**Bad:** "Monogamy is a social construct and I've chosen to reject..."

Your bio isn't a manifesto.

## Testing What Works

### How to Know It's Working

- Matches understand before you chat
- Fewer "wait, you have a partner?" moments
- Attracting ENM-friendly people
- Filtering happens pre-match, not post

### If You're Getting Wrong Matches

- Be more explicit about your situation
- Add "ask me about it" to invite questions
- Mention partner(s) directly
- Use clearer terminology
