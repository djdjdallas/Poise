You need therapy support, but you're worried about judgment. Will a therapist blame your polyamory for your problems? Will they push monogamy as the "healthy" choice?

## FAQ

**What if my therapist suggests monogamy?**
If they're genuinely suggesting your relationship structure is the problem (not that a specific relationship is unhealthy), consider finding a new therapist. You can also address it directly: "I'm not here to work on my relationship structure. Can you support me within my chosen configuration?"

**Can I see a therapist with multiple partners?**
Some therapists will work with various configurations. Discuss what you need. Couples therapy with different partners at different times is common.

**Is couples therapy only for two people?**
Traditional couples therapy is designed for dyads. Some therapists work with triads or polycules, but it's specialized. Ask specifically.

**How do I know if my therapist is actually poly-friendly vs. just tolerant?**
A truly poly-friendly therapist understands the dynamics, uses correct terminology, and works within your framework. A tolerant therapist accepts it but may not understand the nuances.
