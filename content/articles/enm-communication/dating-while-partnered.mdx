## FAQ

**How do I find time to date with an existing partner?**
Intentional scheduling, efficiency in dating (don't pursue everyone), and clear communication about time allocation with all partners.

**Should I always tell dates about my partner immediately?**
Yes—early disclosure is ethical and practical. Profile mention or first messages is best.

**What if my partner doesn't want me to date?**
That's a fundamental incompatibility you need to address before dating others. Non-consensual "opening" isn't ethical.

**How do I not feel guilty when dating someone new?**
Remind yourself this is consensual and agreed upon. Communication with partner helps. Time often eases the guilt.
