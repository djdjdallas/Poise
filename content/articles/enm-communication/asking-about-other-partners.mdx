In ENM, knowing about someone's other partners matters—for practical reasons, emotional reasons, and compatibility reasons. But asking can feel awkward. What's okay to ask? When? How?

Here are the scripts and approaches you need.

## Why You'd Want to Know

### Practical Reasons

**Logistics:**
- Scheduling around their other commitments
- Understanding their availability
- Knowing who they're connected to

### Compatibility Assessment

**Fit questions:**
- Does their relationship structure work with yours?
- Are they saturated or looking for more?
- What kind of partner are they?

### Safety Considerations

**Health and safety:**
- STI considerations
- Who's in their intimate network
- Risk profile of their connections

### Emotional Clarity

**Understanding:**
- How they feel about their other partners
- Where you fit in their life
- What you might be to them

---

## When to Ask

### Early Conversation (Appropriate)

**Good early questions:**
- "What's your relationship situation?"
- "Are you currently seeing other people?"
- "What's your partner situation like?"

These are normal getting-to-know-you questions in ENM contexts.

### Getting More Serious (Appropriate)

**As things develop:**
- More specific questions about structure
- How their relationships affect availability
- What their other partners know about you

### Before Physical Intimacy (Often Necessary)

**Health-related:**
- Who they're intimate with
- Barrier use with others
- Testing practices

### After You're Established (Ongoing)

**Continued communication:**
- Check-ins about changes
- Updates that affect you
- New developments

---

## What's Okay to Ask

### Generally Appropriate

**Basic questions:**
- How many partners do you have?
- What's your relationship structure?
- Are you looking for additional partners?
- What do your partners know about us?

**Practical questions:**
- When do you typically see your other partners?
- How does scheduling usually work for you?
- What kind of availability do you have?

**Safety questions:**
- What safer sex practices do you have?
- When were you last tested?
- What's your barrier use with other partners?

### Usually Appropriate (Depending on Context)

**Relationship dynamics:**
- How long have you been with your other partners?
- Do you have a primary/nesting partner?
- What does your hierarchy look like (if any)?

**About you specifically:**
- What have you told them about me?
- How do they feel about you dating?
- Would I ever meet them?

### Ask Carefully / May Be Too Personal

**Sensitive territory:**
- Details about their other partners' lives
- Intimate details about other relationships
- Specific information their other partners might not want shared

---

## What's Not Your Business

### Generally Off-Limits

**Respect privacy of others:**
- Their other partners' personal information they haven't shared
- Details of their other relationships that don't affect you
- Specifics about their other partners' lives, families, etc.

### Your Partner's to Share (Or Not)

**Their discretion:**
- How their other relationships are going emotionally
- Private details of other relationships
- Information their other partners consider confidential

### The Test

**Ask yourself:**
- Do I need this information, or am I just curious?
- Would this person be comfortable with me knowing this?
- Is this any of my business?

## How to Ask

### Frame With Context

**Why you're asking:**
> "I'm trying to understand your situation so I know what to expect. Can I ask about your other partners?"

> "As we're getting more serious, I'd like to know more about your relationship structure. Is that okay?"

### Be Direct but Respectful

**Good approach:**
> "How many other people are you currently seeing?"

> "What does your partner know about us dating?"

### Acknowledge It Might Feel Awkward

**Normalizing:**
> "I know these questions can feel strange, but I want to be on the same page about your other relationships."

### Leave Room for Boundaries

**Respecting limits:**
> "I have some questions about your partner situation. Let me know if anything feels too personal—I don't want to pry."

---

## Specific Scripts

### Early Dating Stage

**General structure question:**
> "I'd love to hear more about your relationship situation. Are you seeing other people? What does that look like?"

**Availability question:**
> "What's your typical schedule like? I'm trying to understand how dating fits into your life."

### As Things Get Serious

**More detailed:**
> "Now that we're seeing each other more, I'd like to understand your other relationships better. Can you tell me about who else you're seeing?"

**About your place:**
> "I'm curious where I fit into your relationship structure. What do your other partners know about me?"

### Before Intimacy

**Health conversation:**
> "Before we move forward physically, I want to make sure we're on the same page about safer sex. Can we talk about who you're intimate with and what practices you have?"

### Ongoing Check-ins

**Regular updates:**
> "Anything new with your other relationships I should know about? Any changes that affect us?"

## When They Don't Want to Share

### Respect Their Boundaries

**Possible responses:**
- "I understand if that's private. Is there anything you can share that helps me understand your situation?"
- "I respect that you don't want to share details. Can you at least tell me what I need to know for scheduling/safety?"

### Consider What It Means

**If they won't share basics:**
- Is this a red flag?
- Are they protecting privacy appropriately, or hiding something?
- Does this work for you?

### Decide What You Need

**Your requirements:**
- What do you actually need to know vs. want to know?
- What's a dealbreaker if not shared?
- Where's your boundary?

---

## What You Should Share in Return

### Reciprocity Matters

**Be prepared to share:**
- Your own relationship situation
- Information about your partners
- Your practices and agreements

### Model Transparency

**If you want openness:**
- Demonstrate it yourself
- Share proactively
- Create a culture of transparency between you

---

## Common Concerns

### "Will It Seem Like I'm Jealous?"

**Reframe:**
- Asking questions isn't jealousy
- It's information-seeking
- Healthy communication
- Frame it as practical, not anxious

### "What If They Think I'm Prying?"

**Approach:**
- Ask permission first
- Explain your reasons
- Accept boundaries gracefully
- There's a difference between curiosity and interrogation

### "What If I Don't Like the Answers?"

**Reality:**
- Better to know than not
- You can make informed decisions
- Some answers might not work for you
- That's valid information too

## FAQ

**Should I ask to see photos of their other partners?**
That's often too personal unless offered. You can ask generally what they're like, but don't expect/demand visual information.

**Can I ask about problems in their other relationships?**
Be careful. This is sensitive territory. If it affects you, yes. If it's just curiosity, probably not your business.

**What if they have a DADT (don't ask, don't tell) policy?**
Decide if that works for you. Many ENM people don't do DADT. Know your needs.

**Should I share what they tell me with my other partners?**
Not without permission. What they share with you isn't automatically yours to share.
