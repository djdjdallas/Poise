Scheduling in ENM means coordinating multiple calendars, respecting everyone's time, and communicating clearly. Here are the actual scripts and templates you need to make it work.

---

## Asking for a Date

### Initial Ask (New Connection)

**Simple and direct:**
> "I've really enjoyed getting to know you. Would you like to meet up this week? I'm free [day] evening or [day] afternoon."

**More specific:**
> "I'd love to continue this conversation in person. How about coffee or a drink? I have availability on [day] after 6pm or [day] anytime."

**With context:**
> "I'm looking at my calendar and have some openings coming up. Any interest in grabbing dinner? I'm free [specific options]."

### Asking an Established Partner

**Checking in:**
> "Looking at next week—when would be good for you? I want to make sure we get quality time."

**Proposing specific time:**
> "Can I claim [day] evening for us? I was thinking we could [activity idea]."

**When schedules are tight:**
> "I know we've both been busy. Can we carve out at least a few hours this week? What works for you?"

---

## Communicating Availability

### Sharing Your Constraints

**With a new connection:**
> "I should mention—I have limited availability on weekends due to other commitments. Weeknights work best for me, especially Tuesday-Thursday."

**More detail when appropriate:**
> "My schedule is that I usually see my nesting partner on weekends and have weeknight availability for other connections. Does that work with your schedule?"

### When Availability Is Complicated

**Multiple partners:**
> "My availability varies week to week depending on who's traveling, etc. Let me check my calendar and get back to you with some options."

**When you're busy:**
> "My next few weeks are packed. I can do [specific date] or we might need to look further out. I don't want to rush or squeeze you in—you deserve better than that."

---

## Coordinating With Existing Partner(s)

### Checking Before Committing

**To your partner:**
> "Hey, someone asked me to hang out [day]. Do we have anything planned? I wanted to check with you before I commit."

**When you have standing plans:**
> "I know [day] is usually our night. [Person] asked if I'm free. Would you be okay if I moved our time to [alternative] this week?"

### Requesting Time for a Date

**Clear request:**
> "I'd like to plan a date with [person] this week. Can we look at the calendar together and find a time that works?"

**When you need specific day:**
> "Would you be okay with me taking [day] for a date? I'll make sure we have [alternative day] for us."

### After Coordination

**Confirming with the date:**
> "I checked my calendar and [day] works great. How about [time] at [place]?"

## Handling Schedule Conflicts

### When You Need to Reschedule

**Proactive communication:**
> "I'm so sorry, but I need to reschedule [day]. Something came up with [general reason without oversharing]. Can we do [alternative date] instead?"

**When partner needs take priority:**
> "I hate to do this, but [partner] needs me [day]. Can we move our date to [alternative]? I really want to see you."

### When They Need to Reschedule

**Gracious response:**
> "No worries at all—life happens! Let me know what works better for you."

**Suggesting alternatives:**
> "That's okay. How about [alternative date] instead? Or let me know what your week looks like."

### When Schedules Don't Align

**Being honest:**
> "I'm looking at our schedules and I'm having trouble finding overlap. Can we get creative? Maybe a lunch date instead of dinner? Or a quick coffee?"

**When it's ongoing:**
> "Our schedules seem to keep conflicting. Let's look at two or three weeks out and try to lock something in."

## Different Types of Dates

### Planning a First Date

**Suggesting options:**
> "For a first meeting, how about something casual? Coffee or a drink works for me. Any preference?"

**Offering flexibility:**
> "I'm flexible on what we do—happy to grab coffee, go for a walk, or get dinner. What sounds good to you?"

### Planning a Longer Date

**Making space:**
> "I have the whole evening free on [day]. Want to do dinner and then maybe [activity]? I'd love to have more time together."

### Planning an Overnight

**Clear communication:**
> "I'd love to have a longer date—maybe one where I don't have to rush home. Would you be open to an overnight sometime? I'd need to coordinate with my partner, but I wanted to see if you were interested first."

**After getting approval:**
> "Good news—[day] is clear for an overnight if you're still interested. What do you think?"

## Communicating With New Connections About Your Structure

### Explaining Your Availability

**Early conversation:**
> "I want to be upfront about my availability. I'm polyamorous, so my calendar involves coordinating with my [partner/partners]. Weeknight evenings are usually when I'm free to see other people."

### When They Ask About Your Schedule

**Honest and clear:**
> "My partner and I usually have weekends together, so my dating availability is mostly weeknight evenings. Does that work with what you're looking for?"

### If They're New to ENM

**Explanation:**
> "Since I have other relationships, I calendar-share with my partner so we can coordinate. It might seem formal, but it helps everyone feel secure and respected."

## Weekly Check-In Scripts

### With Nesting Partner

**Regular sync:**
> "Want to look at next week together? I want to make sure we're on the same page about what's planned."

**When things are scheduled:**
> "Here's what I have on the calendar: [date with person] on [day], us on [days]. Anything you need to add or any concerns?"

### With Other Partners

**Maintaining connection:**
> "Looking at my schedule for the next couple weeks. When can I see you? I want to make sure we get time together."

---

## Special Situations

### Holidays and Special Occasions

**Navigating who gets what:**
> "I want to talk about [holiday]. I know it's important to both of us. What are your hopes for how we spend it?"

**Proposing a plan:**
> "[Holiday] is coming up. Would you be open to [specific proposal]? I want to make sure everyone feels valued."

### When Someone Feels Neglected

**Addressing it proactively:**
> "I realize we haven't had as much time together lately. I want to prioritize us. Can we block out [date] and make it special?"

### Planning Ahead for Busy Periods

**Proactive scheduling:**
> "Next month is going to be hectic. Can we look at the calendar now and lock in some dates so we don't lose connection during the chaos?"

---

## Follow-Up Scripts

### After Scheduling

**Confirming details:**
> "So we're on for [day] at [time] at [place]. Looking forward to it!"

**Day-before reminder:**
> "Just confirming tomorrow—[time] at [place]? Can't wait to see you."

### If You Haven't Heard Back

**Gentle nudge:**
> "Hey! Just checking if [day] still works for you? Let me know if we need to adjust."

**If still no response:**
> "I want to make sure we're still on for [day]. If you need to reschedule, no worries—just let me know."

## FAQ

**How much detail should I share about why I'm unavailable?**
You don't owe detailed explanations. "I have plans" is sufficient. If you're comfortable sharing more, that's your choice.

**Should I always check with my partner before scheduling?**
Depends on your agreements. Some couples check everything; others have standing autonomy with certain days. Know your agreements.

**What if someone wants more time than I can offer?**
Be honest: "I have [X] amount of time available for dating outside my existing relationship. If that's not enough for you, I understand."

**How do I handle last-minute date requests?**
Depends on your availability and agreements. "Let me check my calendar and get back to you" is always okay.
