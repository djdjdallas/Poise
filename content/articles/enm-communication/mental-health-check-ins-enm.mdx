## FAQ

**How often should we do check-ins?**
Weekly light check-ins, monthly deeper ones, and as needed. Adjust based on what works and what's happening in your lives.

**What if my partner doesn't want to check in?**
Respect their preference while expressing why it matters to you. Model it yourself. Consider if this is a compatibility issue over time.

**What if check-ins always turn into heavy conversations?**
Balance is key. Not every check-in needs to be deep. Sometimes "How are you?" "Good!" is fine. If issues consistently arise, that's information to address.

**How do I check in without being intrusive?**
Frame it as caring, not interrogating. Share your own state too. Accept brief answers sometimes. Make it feel safe to share or not share.
