When your partners are in conflict with each other, you're in an impossible-feeling position. You care about both, you want peace, and you're stuck in the middle.

Here's how to navigate when your partners are fighting.

---

## Why This Is So Hard

### You Love Both

**The core difficulty:**
- You care about both people
- Both are hurt
- Both may want your support
- Both may expect you to take their side

### No Perfect Solution

**Reality:**
- You can't make everyone happy
- Someone may be disappointed
- There may not be a clean resolution
- This just sucks

### You're Affected Too

**Remember:**
- This impacts your wellbeing
- You have your own feelings
- You're not just a bystander
- Your needs matter

---

## Your Role (and Limits)

### What You Can Do

**Helpful actions:**
- Encourage direct communication between them
- Offer perspective when asked
- Support both emotionally (carefully)
- Model good conflict resolution

### What You Shouldn't Do

**Avoid:**
- Taking sides definitively
- Being the constant messenger
- Trying to fix it for them
- Forcing resolution on your timeline

### What You Can't Control

**Accept:**
- They have to resolve their own conflict
- You can't make them get along
- Some things aren't fixable
- Their feelings are theirs

---

## Encouraging Direct Communication

### Why Direct Is Better

**When possible:**
- They work it out themselves
- You're not in the middle
- More likely to stick
- Healthier for everyone

### How to Encourage

**Say things like:**
- "I think you should talk to them directly about this"
- "I can share my perspective, but they need to hear from you"
- "Would you be willing to have a conversation with them?"
- "I'll support you, but I can't be the messenger"

### When Direct Isn't Possible

**If they can't or won't:**
- You may need to relay some things
- But minimize this role
- Set limits on how much
- Push toward direct when possible

## Managing Both Relationships

### Separate Time and Conversations

**Treat separately:**
- Each relationship on its own terms
- Don't constantly talk about the conflict
- Have non-conflict time with each
- Your relationship isn't just about them

### Avoid Triangulation

**Don't:**
- Badmouth one to the other
- Share things said in confidence
- Create alliances
- Play them against each other

### Fairness (Not Identical Treatment)

**Be fair:**
- Hear both sides
- Don't automatically side with one
- Give both your support

**But not necessarily identical:**
- Different needs get different responses
- Context matters
- True neutrality may not be possible or appropriate

---

## When They Want You to Choose

### Handling "Them or Me"

**If ultimatums come:**
- Push back gently
- "I won't choose, but I understand you're hurting"
- Explore what's really behind the ultimatum
- Don't make crisis decisions

### When You Do Have Opinions

**You may have views on:**
- Who's more "right"
- What would help
- What behavior is unacceptable

**Share carefully:**
- Be honest but diplomatic
- Own it as your perspective
- Don't weaponize your view
- Remember you have incomplete information

### Protecting Your Position

**You can say:**
- "I love you both and won't choose between you"
- "I need you to work this out without putting me in the middle"
- "I'm happy to support each of you, but not to be the battleground"

## Self-Care While in the Middle

### Recognize Your Stress

**You're experiencing:**
- Divided loyalties
- Emotional labor
- Conflict exposure
- Relationship stress

### Set Your Limits

**Protect yourself:**
- Limit how much you engage with the conflict
- Take breaks from discussing it
- Maintain your own wellbeing
- Have your own support system

### Get Your Own Support

**Turn to:**
- Friends not involved
- Therapist
- Community support
- Anyone who can support you

---

## When Things Don't Resolve

### Accepting Ongoing Tension

**Sometimes:**
- They won't be close
- Tension remains
- Parallel becomes necessary
- That's the new normal

### Managing Long-Term

**If unresolved:**
- Minimize their interaction
- Protect your relationships individually
- Accept the limits
- Find workable arrangements

### Impact on Your Relationships

**Consider:**
- Is this sustainable for you?
- What support do you need?
- Are your relationships suffering?
- What might need to change?

---

## When It Affects Your Relationships

### Conflict Bleeding Over

**If their conflict:**
- Creates conflict in your relationships
- Makes one or both hard to be with
- Becomes the dominant topic

**Address it:**
- "I need us to talk about other things too"
- "This conflict is affecting our relationship"
- "I need support, not just more conflict"

### Evaluating Sustainability

**Ask yourself:**
- Can I maintain both relationships like this?
- Is this affecting my mental health?
- What would need to change?
- What are my limits?

## FAQ

**Should I try to mediate between my partners?**
You can facilitate conversation, but formal mediation might be better done by a neutral party. Don't take full responsibility for resolution.

**What if one partner is clearly "wrong"?**
You can share your perspective, but be careful about definitively taking sides. Focus on behavior and impact rather than right/wrong.

**Can I require them to get along?**
You can't force feelings, but you can set boundaries about behavior (no badmouthing, civil when together, etc.).

**What if this makes me want to end one relationship?**
If handling this reveals incompatibilities or dealbreakers, that's valid. Don't make decisions in crisis, but take your feelings seriously.
