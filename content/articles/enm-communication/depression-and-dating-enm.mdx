- Your value as a partner

### Communication and Connection

**Depression impacts:**
- Response time and quality
- Emotional availability
- Presence during conversations
- Ability to show interest
- Capacity for vulnerability

## ENM-Specific Challenges

- Guilt about not being "enough"
- Comparison to how you "should" be

### Dating New People

**Added difficulty:**
- Putting yourself out there feels impossible
- First impressions require energy you don't have
- New people don't know your baseline
- Explaining depression to new matches

### Partner Dynamics

**Depression can affect:**

### Reasons to Pause

**Consider pausing if:**

## Communicating About Depression

### With Existing Partners

**What to share:**
- Your current state
- What you need from them
- What you can realistically give
- How they can help (or not)
- That it's not about them

**Example:**
"I'm in a depression dip right now. I might be less responsive and lower energy. I still care about you—this is just what I'm dealing with."

### With New Matches

**Timing matters:**
- Not necessary in first messages
- Before meeting is often appropriate
- When things start to get real
- When it affects your interactions

**How to share:**
- Matter-of-fact, not dramatic
- Brief explanation
- What it means for them
- Not seeking to be fixed

### What Partners Don't Need

**You don't owe:**
- Complete history
- Constant updates
- Justification for your illness
- More than you can give

## Managing ENM While Depressed

### Reduce Where Possible

**Consider:**

- Routines that don't require decisions

### Use Your Support System

**Partners can:**
- Offer understanding
- Provide low-pressure connection
- Help with practical things
- Be patient with your process

**But shouldn't:**
- Be your only support
- Replace professional help
- Fix your depression

## Dating Apps While Depressed

### Energy Conservation

**Save energy by:**
- Limiting app time
- Quality over quantity
- Templating where appropriate
- Not forcing conversations
- Taking breaks guilt-free

### Profile Considerations

- Perform happiness

**You might want to:**
- Be authentic about being low-key
- Seek compatible energy levels
- Avoid pressure-heavy profiles

### Responding When Low

**It's okay to:**

## Treatment Comes First

### How Treatment Helps Dating

**With treatment:**

## FAQ

**Should I tell matches I have depression?**
Eventually, yes—especially if it affects your interactions. You don't need to lead with it, but honesty before things get serious is important.

**What if I can't give partners what they need?**
Be honest about your capacity. Some will stay, some won't. It's better to be real than to pretend and burn out.

**Is it selfish to date while depressed?**
No, as long as you're honest and managing your depression. You deserve connection. Just don't use others as treatment.

**How do I explain canceled plans?**
"I'm having a rough mental health day and need to reschedule." You don't owe more explanation than that.
