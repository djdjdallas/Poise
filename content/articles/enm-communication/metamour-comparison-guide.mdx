"They're more attractive, more interesting, better in bed..."

Comparing yourself to your metamour (your partner's other partner) is one of the most common struggles in polyamory. Even when you know it's unhelpful, the comparisons keep coming.

This guide offers practical strategies for breaking the comparison cycle and building genuine security.

## Why We Compare

### It's Human Nature

Comparison is evolutionarily wired:
- Assessing threats to resources (including partners)
- Determining social standing
- Seeking information about ourselves

In polyamory, this instinct goes into overdrive because there's a tangible "other" to compare against.

### What Comparison Usually Masks

Surface comparison often covers:
- Fear of abandonment
- Low self-worth
- Need for reassurance
- Unmet needs in the relationship
- Past relationship trauma

The metamour isn't really the issue—they're the screen onto which you project your fears.

## The Comparison Trap

### How It Works

1. You learn something about your metamour
2. Your brain highlights how they're "better" in some way
3. You feel worse about yourself
4. You seek information to compare again
5. Repeat

### What You're Actually Comparing

Often unfair comparisons:
- Their best features vs. your worst
- What you imagine vs. what you know about yourself
- Their social media presence vs. your inner experience
- Cherry-picked highlights vs. your full reality

You're not comparing full people. You're comparing your complete self-knowledge against curated impressions.

## Strategies to Stop Comparing

### 1. Notice Without Judgment

When you catch yourself comparing:
- Name it: "I'm doing the comparison thing"
- Don't shame yourself
- Don't try to immediately fix it
- Just observe

Awareness is the first step. Self-criticism adds another layer of suffering.

### 2. Limit Information

You might not need to know:
- What they look like
- Details about their dates
- Your partner's praise of them
- Their accomplishments or qualities

Ask yourself: Does this information help me, or just fuel comparison?

### 3. Challenge the Thoughts

When "they're better than me" appears:

**Reality check:** Is this objectively true? How do I know?

**So what test:** Even if true, does it mean I'll be abandoned?

**Alternative explanation:** Could my partner value different things in different people?

### 4. Focus on Your Relationship

Your relationship with your partner is:
- Its own thing
- Not in competition with their other relationships
- Valuable regardless of what else they have

What your partner has with them doesn't diminish what they have with you. Relationships aren't pie.

### 5. Identify What You Actually Need

Comparison often signals unmet needs:

| Comparison thought | Possible underlying need |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| "They're more attractive" | Reassurance that I'm desired |
| "They're more fun" | More quality time/novelty |
| "They're smarter" | To feel intellectually valued |
| "They have more time together" | More priority/attention |

Address the need, not the comparison.

### 6. Build Your Own Worth

Your value isn't relative:
- Focus on what you offer
- Develop yourself independent of relationships
- Remember what your partner loves about you
- Maintain identity outside the relationship

### 7. Practice Gratitude

Shift from scarcity to abundance:
- What do you appreciate about your relationship?
- What does your partner give you?
- What's going well?

Comparison thrives in scarcity mindset. Gratitude counters it.

## When Your Partner Mentions Them

### If Comments Trigger Comparison

It's okay to say:
> "I'm working on comparison stuff. Could you be mindful about how you describe [metamour]? I don't need to hear all the praise right now."

### What's Reasonable to Ask

- Less detailed descriptions of dates
- Avoiding direct comparisons
- Mindfulness about public praise
- Reassurance when you need it

### What's Not Fair to Ask

- Never mentioning them at all
- Pretending they don't exist
- Never expressing care for them
- Suppressing their happiness

---

## Getting to Know (or Not) Your Metamour

### Sometimes More Information Helps

If you tend to imagine them as perfect:
- Meeting them reveals they're human
- Real information can replace fearful imagination
- You might actually like them

### Sometimes Distance Is Better

If information fuels comparison:
- You don't have to be friends
- Parallel poly is valid
- You can have minimal contact
- Knowledge isn't always helpful

There's no right answer—it's what works for you.

---

## Talking to Your Partner

### Asking for Reassurance

It's okay to need reassurance:
> "I've been struggling with comparison lately. Can you remind me what you appreciate about me?"

### What Good Reassurance Looks Like

Not: "You're better than them" (still comparison-based)
But: "Here's what I specifically love about you and us"

### Having a Larger Conversation

If comparison is persistent:
- Talk about what you're experiencing
- Discuss what might help
- Explore if any relationship dynamics are contributing
- Consider if therapy might help

---

## When Comparison Signals Something Real

### Sometimes It's Valid Information

Comparison might reveal:
- You're genuinely getting less than you need
- Your partner treats them better than you
- The relationship isn't meeting your needs
- Something is actually unfair

### How to Tell the Difference

**Unfounded comparison:** Based on imagination and fear
**Valid concern:** Based on concrete behaviors and patterns

If your partner consistently prioritizes them, cancels on you, or treats you measurably worse—that's not just comparison, that's a relationship problem.

---

## Working on Deeper Issues

### If Comparison Persists

Consider:
- Individual therapy (especially for self-worth issues)
- Couples therapy (for relationship dynamics)
- Poly-specific support groups
- Journaling and self-reflection

### Building Long-Term Security

Security comes from:
- Consistent positive experiences
- Trust built over time
- Internal self-worth work
- A partner who shows up for you

Comparison tends to fade as security grows.
