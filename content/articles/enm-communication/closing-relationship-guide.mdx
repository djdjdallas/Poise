Few conversations in ethical non-monogamy are harder than: "I want to close the relationship."

Whether you're the one asking or the one being asked, this conversation involves real stakes—your relationship, your identity, and potentially other people you care about.

This guide helps you navigate what to do when closing becomes a possibility.

## Why Partners Want to Close

### Common Reasons

- **Jealousy or insecurity** that isn't improving
- **Life changes** (new job, kids, health issues)
- **Realizing monogamy fits better** for them
- **Relationship problems** that feel related to openness
- **A specific situation** with a metamour
- **Burnout** from the complexity
- **Values shift** over time

### What to Understand

Wanting to close doesn't mean:
- They're trying to control you
- The open relationship failed
- You did something wrong
- They don't love you

It usually means they're struggling with something and see closing as a solution.

## If Your Partner Wants to Close

### First Response

Don't react immediately with:
- Defensiveness
- Dismissal
- Panic
- Promises to change

Instead:
- Listen fully
- Ask clarifying questions
- Thank them for telling you
- Ask for time to process

### Questions to Understand

- What specifically is driving this?
- Is this about a specific situation or a general feeling?
- What have you tried to address these feelings?
- What would closing look like in your mind?
- Is this negotiable or decided?

### Taking Time

It's okay to say:
> "This is really significant and I need time to think about it. Can we talk again in a few days after I've processed?"

Don't make major decisions in the initial emotional wave.

## If You Want to Close

### Before the Conversation

Reflect honestly:
- Is closing addressing the real issue?
- Have I communicated my needs clearly first?
- Is this about my feelings or my partner's behavior?
- What am I hoping closing will solve?

### How to Bring It Up

**Timing:** Not during conflict, not when stressed, not in public

**Framing:** "I need to talk about something important for our relationship. When's a good time?"

**Approach:** Lead with your feelings and needs, not demands

> "I've been struggling with our open relationship and I want to talk about whether closing might be right for us. I'm not issuing an ultimatum—I want to explore this together."

### What to Share

- What you're experiencing emotionally
- What you've tried already
- What you're hoping for
- Whether this is a discussion or a decision

---

## Having the Conversation

### What to Explore Together

1. **What's actually not working?**
   - Is it the structure or something else?
   - Would different boundaries help?
   - Are needs going unmet that could be addressed?

2. **What would closing mean practically?**
   - End all other relationships immediately?
   - Gradual transition?
   - "Pause" vs. permanent close?

3. **Who else is affected?**
   - Do you have other partners who'd be ended?
   - What's fair to them?
   - How do you handle that ethically?

4. **What's each person willing to do?**
   - Is monogamy acceptable to both?
   - Are there alternatives to explore first?
   - What would make this work for everyone?

## Options Beyond "Open" or "Closed"

### Before Deciding, Consider

- **Therapy:** Individual or couples, especially with ENM-aware therapist
- **Temporary pause:** Close for a defined period, reassess
- **Modified structure:** Different rules, less outside involvement
- **Addressing specific issues:** What if the trigger was resolved?
- **More communication:** Regular check-ins, better processing

### Sometimes the Issue Isn't Openness

Closing won't fix:
- Fundamental incompatibility
- Poor communication patterns
- Trust issues unrelated to ENM
- Mismatched life goals
- Relationship neglect

If these are the real problems, monogamy won't solve them.

## When You Can't Agree

### If They Want to Close and You Don't

Hard truths:
- You can't force someone to be poly
- Staying open against their wishes isn't ethical
- You have to choose: relationship or polyamory
- Resentful monogamy doesn't work long-term

### If You Want to Close and They Don't

Equally hard:
- You can't force monogamy
- Your needs matter too
- Continuing open when it's hurting you isn't sustainable
- Incompatibility is a real possibility

### Possible Outcomes

1. **Compromise:** Find a middle ground that works (temporarily or long-term)
2. **One person sacrifices:** High risk of resentment
3. **Separation:** Acknowledge incompatibility lovingly
4. **Trial period:** Try one approach for set time, then reassess

## Closing Ethically

### If Other Partners Are Involved

You can't just disappear. Ethical closing means:
- Honest conversations with other partners
- Reasonable transition time (when possible)
- Not blaming them for the decision
- Acknowledging their feelings matter

### What to Say to Other Partners

> "My partner and I have decided to close our relationship. This isn't about you or anything you did. I care about you and I'm sorry this is happening."

### How Much Time?

- Immediate close: Only if safety requires it
- Reasonable transition: Weeks to a few months
- Depends on: Depth of relationships, circumstances, agreements

---

## After Closing

### If You Close

- Give it genuine effort
- Don't use it as punishment
- Process grief about what you're giving up
- Build the relationship you're choosing
- Reassess periodically

### What to Watch For

Signs closing was right:
- Relief
- Renewed connection
- Issues improving

Signs closing isn't working:
- Resentment building
- Longing for openness
- Original issues still present
- Feeling trapped

### It's Not Necessarily Permanent

Some couples:
- Close temporarily and reopen later
- Close and stay closed happily
- Close and realize it doesn't help
- Try different structures over time

Relationships evolve. This decision can too.
