Time is polyamory's most limited resource. Managing it well makes the difference between thriving relationships and resentful ones.

Here are systems that actually work.

---

## The Challenge

### Why Time Is Hard

- You only have so many hours
- Each relationship needs attention
- Life doesn't pause for dating
- Quality matters more than quantity
- Perception of fairness affects feelings

### Common Problems

- Someone always feels neglected
- Calendar overwhelm
- No time for yourself
- Constant negotiation
- Resentment over allocation

---

## Foundational Principles

### Principle 1: Time ≠ Love

Spending more time with one partner doesn't mean loving them more. Help everyone understand this—including yourself.

### Principle 2: Quality Over Quantity

Three hours of present, connected time > eight hours of distracted cohabitation.

### Principle 3: Sustainability Over Perfection

A system you can maintain beats an "ideal" system that collapses.

### Principle 4: Communication Is Part of the System

The system isn't just scheduling—it's how you talk about scheduling.

## System 1: The Shared Calendar

### How It Works

Everyone in the polycule has access to a shared calendar showing:
- Who has dates when
- Partner time commitments
- Work and life obligations
- Blocked personal time

### Tools

- Google Calendar (shared)
- Apple Calendar (shared)
- Poly-specific apps (Polycule, etc.)
- Simple paper calendar

### Best Practices

**What to include:**
- "Date with [name]" (times blocked)
- "Personal time" (protected)
- Travel or unavailability
- Flexible vs. firm commitments

**What not to include:**
- Every detail of what you're doing
- Anything partners haven't consented to share
- More information than needed

### Who It Works For

- Highly scheduled polycules
- Nesting partners coordinating home time
- People who like visual systems
- Those prone to double-booking

---

## System 2: Anchor Scheduling

### How It Works

Each relationship has "anchor" times that are predictable:
- "Tuesday evenings are my time with [partner A]"
- "Alternate weekends with [partner B]"
- "First Thursday of the month for [partner C]"

### The Framework

**Regular anchors:**
- Consistent, recurring times
- Established in advance
- Only changed by mutual agreement
- Create predictability

**Floating time:**
- Flexible additional time
- Scheduled as available
- Less guaranteed
- For supplementing anchors

### Benefits

- Predictability reduces anxiety
- Less negotiation needed
- Everyone knows their "guaranteed" time
- Easier for people to plan their own lives

### Challenges

- Life doesn't always fit neat schedules
- Can feel rigid
- Spontaneity is harder
- May need regular renegotiation

---

## System 3: Points/Budget System

### How It Works

Think of your time as a budget:
- X hours/week available for dating
- Allocated across relationships
- Tracked (roughly) to ensure fairness

### Example

*20 dating hours/week available:*
- Partner A: 8 hours
- Partner B: 6 hours
- Partner C: 4 hours
- Flex/new connections: 2 hours

### Benefits

- Forces realistic assessment of capacity
- Makes allocation conscious
- Helps identify when you're overcommitted
- Provides framework for conversations

### Challenges

- Can feel transactional
- Relationships don't work in perfect math
- Hard to track precisely
- May create resentment if too rigid

---

## System 4: Needs-Based Allocation

### How It Works

Rather than equal time, allocate based on what each relationship needs:
- New relationships might need more investment initially
- Established ones might need maintenance time
- Crisis periods get more attention
- Stability periods get less

### The Conversation

Regularly discuss:
- "What does each relationship need right now?"
- "Where should energy flow?"
- "Is anyone feeling neglected?"

### Benefits

- Responsive to actual needs
- Flexible to changing circumstances
- Acknowledges relationships differ
- Prevents "equal but insufficient" problem

### Challenges

- Requires constant communication
- Can feel unfair to some
- Hard to explain needs
- May default to squeaky wheel

---

## Practical Scheduling Tips

### Weekly Planning

Set aside time weekly to:
- Look at the coming week
- Identify conflicts and gaps
- Communicate with all partners
- Confirm commitments

### Buffer Time

Build in:
- Transition time between dates
- Recovery/alone time
- Unexpected life needs
- Flexibility for changes

### Protect Personal Time

Schedule time for:
- Yourself (non-negotiable)
- Friends (non-romantic relationships)
- Rest (do nothing)
- Life maintenance

### Date Planning Efficiency

- Batch scheduling conversations
- Set regular date nights that don't need negotiation
- Use async communication for scheduling
- Don't overplan—leave spontaneity room

## Communication Around Time

### When You Need More Time

> "I've been feeling like I need more connection time with you. Can we look at our schedules and see if there's room to add time, even occasionally?"

### When Someone Needs More Time

> "I hear that you're wanting more time together. Let me look at what I can move around. I want to make this work."

### When Time Is Tight

> "This season is really busy. I want to be honest that I can't give more than [amount] right now. Is that workable, or do we need to discuss what that means?"

### When You're Overcommitted

> "I've realized I've overcommitted and I'm not sustainable at this pace. I need to pull back [amount]. I'm sorry, and I want to figure out what works going forward."

## When Partners Have Different Needs

### The Disparity Problem

Partners may want different amounts of time:
- One wants daily contact; another wants weekly dates
- One wants cohabitation time; another prefers separate lives
- One craves quantity; another prefers intensity

### How to Navigate

**Assess your capacity:**
What can you actually sustainably give?

**Communicate honestly:**
> "I can offer [amount]. I know you'd like more, but that's my realistic maximum right now."

**Find creative solutions:**
- Different types of time (quality vs. quantity)
- Virtual connection supplementing in-person
- Adjusting expectations vs. adjusting allocation

**Accept incompatibility:**
Sometimes time needs don't match. That's real information about compatibility.

---

## Handling Conflicts

### Double-Booking

**When it happens:**
- Apologize to whoever loses out
- Don't make it a pattern
- Learn and adjust your system
- Make it up if possible

**Prevention:**
- One calendar system
- Check before committing
- Don't over-promise

### Someone Feels Neglected

**Listen first:**
> "Tell me more about how you're feeling. I want to understand."

**Then problem-solve:**
> "Let's figure out what would help. Is it more time, or more connection during the time we have?"

### Emergency Time Requests

**When someone needs more suddenly:**
- Assess the urgency
- Communicate with affected partners
- Make temporary adjustments
- Return to baseline when resolved

**Script for asking others to flex:**
> "[Partner] is going through something and needs extra support right now. Would you be okay if I adjusted our plans this week? I'll make it up to you."

## For Different Relationship Structures

### Nesting Partners

- Don't take cohabitation time for granted
- Schedule "dates" even at home
- Quality time, not just proximity
- Clear when you're unavailable even if home

### Long-Distance Partners

- Schedule virtual time as real commitments
- Plan visits well in advance
- Recognize their time is limited
- Make in-person time count

### New vs. Established

- NRE can steal time from established relationships
- Consciously protect existing connection time
- New relationships don't automatically get more
- Rebalance as new relationships stabilize

---

## Tools and Apps

### Calendar Apps

- Google Calendar (sharing, multiple calendars)
- Apple Calendar (ecosystem integration)
- Notion (customizable tracking)

### Poly-Specific Tools

- Polycule.me (relationship-focused)
- Other poly calendar apps (various)

### Communication Apps
