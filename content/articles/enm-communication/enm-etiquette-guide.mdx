ENM has an etiquette—unwritten rules the community expects you to know. Breaking them marks you as inexperienced at best, unsafe at worst.

Here's the etiquette guide that'll help you avoid being "that person."

---

## The Foundation: Consent and Honesty

### Everything Builds on This

ENM etiquette isn't arbitrary—it stems from core values:
- **Informed consent:** Everyone affected knows and agrees
- **Honesty:** No lying, even by omission
- **Respect:** Treating everyone as full people
- **Communication:** Saying what you mean, meaning what you say

When in doubt, ask: "Does this honor consent and honesty?"

## Partner Awareness

### The Rule

If you have partners, they should know you're dating. Period.

**Not negotiable:**
- "My partner doesn't need to know" = not ENM
- "It's complicated" = sort it out before dating others
- "We have don't-ask-don't-tell" = be prepared for skepticism

### How to Handle Questions

People will ask about your partner's awareness. Be ready:

> "Yes, my partner knows and is supportive. They date separately too."

> "My partner and I have discussed this extensively. They're not involved in my dating but they're fully aware."

### If Your Partner Doesn't Know

Stop. Don't use Feeld. Don't call it ENM. Sort out your primary relationship first.

## Disclosure Etiquette

### What to Disclose (and When)

**Before matching/first messages:**
Your profile should include:
- Relationship structure
- That you're ENM
- Whether you're dating together or separately

**Early in conversation:**
- Partner situation
- What you're looking for
- Any major constraints
- Experience level

**Before meeting:**
- Anything that significantly affects them
- Boundaries and expectations
- STI status if relevant

### What You Don't Owe

You don't have to share:
- Every detail of your relationship agreements
- Your partner's identifying information
- More than you're comfortable with early on

### The Principle

Give people enough information to make informed decisions about connecting with you.

## Messaging Etiquette

### Responding

**Do:**
- Respond to genuine messages within reasonable time
- Give a clear decline if not interested
- Not ghost people after real conversation

**Don't:**
- Leave people hanging indefinitely
- Fade away hoping they'll take the hint
- Feel obligated to respond to low-effort messages

### Communication Style

**Good etiquette:**
- Full sentences when the conversation warrants
- Asking questions, not just answering
- Being clear about interest level
- Matching investment with investment

**Poor etiquette:**
- One-word answers repeatedly
- Never asking anything
- Disappearing for weeks without acknowledgment
- Breadcrumbing

### Sexual Content

**Ask before sending:**
- Explicit photos
- Detailed sexual messages
- Kink discussion

> "I'd like to share something explicit—are you comfortable with that?"

Consent applies to digital communication too.

## Dating Etiquette

### Scheduling

**Good practice:**
- Be clear about your availability
- Keep commitments you make
- Give adequate notice for changes
- Acknowledge that everyone has complex schedules

**Poor form:**
- Last-minute cancellations without good reason
- Double-booking or running late
- Expecting others to accommodate your schedule exclusively
- Treating them as less important than "primary" commitments

### On the Date

**Be present:**
- Phone away unless emergency
- Engage fully with the person you're with
- Don't talk exclusively about your other partners

**Be honest:**
- About how you're feeling
- About what you're looking for
- About constraints and limitations

### After the Date

**Good etiquette:**
- Follow up within reasonable time
- Be honest about interest level
- Give a clear no if that's the answer

**Poor form:**
- Ghosting
- Vague "let's do this again sometime" with no intent
- Waiting for them to reach out if you're interested

## Partner/Metamour Etiquette

### Regarding Their Other Relationships

**Don't:**
- Ask for details they haven't offered
- Compare yourself to metamours
- Demand time away from other partners
- Badmouth metamours

**Do:**
- Respect that their other relationships exist
- Understand you're not entitled to all their time
- Ask about what level of metamour contact they prefer
- Be flexible about scheduling realities

### If You Meet Metamours

**Kitchen table poly (everyone's friendly):**
- Be cordial and respectful
- Don't make it weird
- Follow their lead on intimacy level

**Parallel poly (minimal contact):**
- Respect their preference for separation
- Don't push for more contact than desired
- Still be respectful if paths cross

### When There's Conflict

**Handle it through your shared partner:**
- Not through direct confrontation initially
- Acknowledge it's complicated
- Prioritize everyone's wellbeing

---

## Couple-Specific Etiquette

### If You're a Couple

**Don't:**
- Treat people as additions to your relationship
- Expect one person to date both of you
- Make decisions without the person you're dating
- Present a united front against them

**Do:**
- Date people as individuals
- Give the new person voice in the relationship
- Address couple privilege actively
- Make space for your date's preferences

### The Unicorn Hunting Problem

"Unicorn hunting" (couples seeking single bi women for sex) has such a bad reputation that even well-meaning couples face skepticism.

**To avoid being seen as unicorn hunters:**
- Date separately when possible
- Don't require one person to date both of you
- Acknowledge the power imbalance
- Treat the new person as an equal, not a third

---

## Sexual Health Etiquette

### STI Disclosure

**The expectation:**
- Disclose STI status before sexual activity
- Be honest about testing and results
- Discuss safer sex practices

**How to bring it up:**
> "Before we get physical, I want to share that I was last tested [when] and my status is [status]. What are your practices around safer sex?"

### Safer Sex Negotiations

**Good etiquette:**
- Be clear about your practices and boundaries
- Don't pressure partners to change their safer sex practices
- Honor agreements you make
- Inform partners if something changes

### Regarding Partners' Partners

**The question of risk:**
ENM means your sexual health affects multiple people. Etiquette requires:
- Being honest about your network's practices
- Informing partners of relevant changes
- Not making unilateral decisions that affect others' risk

---

## Time and Emotional Labor Etiquette

### Respecting Everyone's Time

**ENM people are often busy:**
- Multiple relationships take time
- Work, life, other commitments exist
- Flexibility matters

**Good etiquette:**
- Don't demand more time than they can give
- Appreciate the time you do get
- Be understanding about scheduling complexity

### Emotional Labor Distribution

**Don't:**
- Expect one person to meet all your needs
- Dump all your processing on partners
- Make your jealousy someone else's problem to fix

**Do:**
- Distribute emotional needs across your support system
- Do your own work on difficult emotions
- Communicate needs without demanding solutions

---

## When Things End

### Ending Connections

**Good etiquette:**
- Be direct when you want to end things
- Give a clear reason (brief, honest)
- Don't fade away hoping they'll disappear
- Be kind but final

**Example:**
> "I've enjoyed getting to know you, but I don't think we're the right match long-term. I wish you well."

### After Endings

**Don't:**
- Badmouth them in the community
- Make it weird if you see them
- Use mutual connections to get information
- Keep reaching out if they've ended it

---

## Community Etiquette

### In ENM Spaces

**At munches, events, parties:**
- Follow the space's rules
- Don't out people outside the space
- Respect consent and boundaries
- Be a positive community member

### Online

**In forums, groups, apps:**
- Don't share private conversations
- Be constructive, not just critical
- Help newcomers learn
- Hold yourself accountable publicly
