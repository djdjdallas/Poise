Boundaries protect your wellbeing and make relationships work. But finding the words can be hard—especially in the moment.

Here are 20 scripts for common boundary situations in ENM.

---

## The Principles

### What Good Boundaries Sound Like

- **Clear:** Say exactly what you mean
- **Direct:** No hedging or hinting
- **Respectful:** Firm but not attacking
- **Owned:** "I" statements, not "you" accusations

### The Basic Formula

1. State the boundary
2. (Optional) Brief reason
3. (If needed) What happens if crossed

---

## Time and Availability Boundaries

### 1. Limiting Contact Frequency

> "I enjoy talking with you, but I need to limit our texting to a few times a day. Constant messaging doesn't work for my life right now."

### 2. Protecting Partner Time

> "Wednesday evenings are my time with [partner]. I'm not available for dates or extended conversations then."

### 3. Response Time Expectations

> "I'm not always able to respond quickly. If you don't hear from me within a day, that's normal for me—it doesn't mean anything's wrong."

### 4. Limiting Date Frequency

> "I can only see you about once a week right now. That's what my schedule and energy allow. I hope that works for you."

---

## Physical and Sexual Boundaries

### 5. Activity Limits

> "I'm not comfortable with [activity]. That's a hard limit for me, not something to negotiate."

### 6. Safer Sex Requirements

> "I need us to use barriers for [activity]. This isn't negotiable for me."

### 7. Pace of Physical Intimacy

> "I'm not ready to [activity] yet. I need more time. I'll let you know when that changes."

### 8. Consent Check-In

> "I need you to check in with me before [activity], every time. Even if we've done it before."

---

## Emotional Boundaries

### 9. Not Processing Their Other Relationships

> "I care about you, but I'm not the right person to process your feelings about [other partner]. Can you talk to a friend or therapist about that?"

### 10. Limiting Emotional Labor

> "I'm not able to provide emotional support right now. I need to focus on my own stuff. Can we talk about this another time?"

### 11. Not Comparing Relationships

> "I'd prefer we don't compare our relationship to your other ones. I want us to focus on what we have, not how it stacks up."

### 12. Information Boundaries

> "I don't want to know details about [topic/person/activity]. Please keep that separate from what you share with me."

---

## Relationship Structure Boundaries

### 13. Not Escalating the Relationship

> "I'm not looking for this relationship to become more entangled. What we have now is what I can offer."

### 14. Hierarchy Clarity

> "My relationship with [partner] is my priority. I'm being upfront that if there's a significant conflict, they come first."

### 15. Not Dating Partners Together

> "I'm not interested in dating you and your partner together. I'm open to connecting with you individually, but not as a couple package."

### 16. Metamour Contact

> "I'd prefer to have minimal contact with your other partners. Parallel poly works better for me."

---

## Communication Boundaries

### 17. Topic Limits

> "I'm not comfortable discussing [topic] right now. Can we talk about something else?"

### 18. Communication Medium

> "I prefer not to have serious conversations over text. Can we talk about this in person or on the phone?"

### 19. Feedback Timing

> "I need some time before I can discuss this. Can we come back to it tomorrow?"

### 20. Argument Limits

> "I'm reaching my limit with this conversation. I need to take a break before I can continue productively."

---

## When Boundaries Are Challenged

### If They Push Back

**Restate calmly:**
> "I understand you might want something different, but this is my boundary. It's not negotiable."

**Don't over-explain:**
You don't need to justify your boundaries. "This is what I need" is enough.

### If They Ask Why

**You can explain briefly:**
> "I've learned this is what works for me. It's based on past experience."

**Or decline:**
> "I'd rather not get into the reasons. I just need you to respect this."

### If They Get Upset

**Acknowledge without caving:**
> "I understand this isn't what you wanted to hear. I'm sorry it's disappointing, but the boundary stands."

### If They Violate the Boundary

**Name it:**
> "That's exactly what I said I wasn't comfortable with. I need you to respect my boundary."

**Decide consequences:**
> "If this continues, I'll need to reconsider our relationship."

## Setting New Boundaries Mid-Relationship

### Script: Introducing a New Boundary

> "I've realized I need to set a boundary that I didn't have before. Going forward, [boundary]. I know this is new, but it's something I need."

### Script: Changing an Existing Agreement

> "Our current agreement about [topic] isn't working for me. I need to change it to [new boundary]. Can we discuss how to make that work?"

### Script: Temporary Boundary

> "For now, I need [boundary]. This might change, but for the immediate future, this is what I need."

## Boundary-Setting Mindset

### Remember

- You have the right to boundaries
- No is a complete sentence
- You don't need permission
- Their reaction is their responsibility
- Good partners respect limits

### Common Obstacles

**"I don't want to be difficult"**
Boundaries aren't difficult—they're necessary.

**"They might leave"**
If they leave because of reasonable boundaries, they weren't right for you.

**"I should be more flexible"**
Flexibility is good; abandoning needs isn't flexibility.

**"It's not that big a deal"**
If it's bothering you, it matters.
