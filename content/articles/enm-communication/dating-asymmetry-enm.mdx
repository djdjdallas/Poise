In ENM, dating success is rarely equal. One partner may have more matches, more dates, more partners—while the other struggles or chooses differently. This asymmetry is common and navigable, but it takes work.

Here's how to handle when dating isn't equal.

## Why Asymmetry Happens

### Different Dating Pools

**Realities include:**
- Different demographics have different experiences
- Queer women dating women vs. men dating women
- Age, location, and other factors
- Dating apps favor some profiles over others

### Different Approaches

**People vary in:**
- Time and energy for dating
- How actively they pursue
- What they're seeking
- Selectivity levels

### Different Wants

**Not everyone wants the same:**
- Some want multiple partners
- Some want occasional dates
- Some are content with one relationship
- Asymmetry sometimes reflects different goals

## Common Asymmetry Patterns

### One Gets More Matches

## Impact of Asymmetry

### On the Less-Dating Partner

## Addressing Feelings

### For the Less-Dating Partner

- Work on your own dating if desired

**Unhelpful approaches:**
- Punishing partner for their success
- Demanding they date less
- Letting resentment fester
- Comparing constantly

### For the More-Dating Partner

**Healthy approaches:**
- Acknowledge the asymmetry
- Be sensitive to partner's feelings

- Make time for your existing relationship

**Unhelpful approaches:**
- Dismissing partner's feelings
- Excessive guilt that limits your dating
- Treating it as their problem only

## Practical Strategies

## Reframing Asymmetry

### It's Not Competition

**Remember:**
- You're not competing with each other
- Different people, different experiences
- Success isn't zero-sum
- Partner's dates don't take from you

### Different Isn't Wrong

**Asymmetry doesn't mean:**
- Someone is failing
- The relationship is broken
- ENM isn't working
- You're doing something wrong

### Focus on Quality

**What matters:**
- Quality of connections, not quantity
- Your own dating journey
- Relationship health overall
- What you actually want

## When You're Dating Less

### Examining Why

**Consider:**
- Is this what I want?
- Am I actively pursuing?
- Are there obstacles to address?
- Is my approach working?

### Making Changes

**If you want more dates:**
- Profile optimization
- More active swiping/pursuing
- Different apps or approaches
- Working on dating skills

### Accepting Difference

**If you're okay with less:**
- That's valid
- Different doesn't mean worse
- Your pace is yours
- Don't date to match partner

### Finding Other Fulfillment

**While partner dates:**
- Pursue your own interests
- Time with friends
- Personal growth
- Activities you enjoy

---

## When You're Dating More

### Managing Guilt

**If you feel guilty:**
- Check if you're neglecting partner
- If not, release the guilt
- Your success is okay
- Don't diminish your joy

### Being Sensitive

**Show care by:**
- Not over-sharing details
- Maintaining relationship investment
- Acknowledging the difference
- Being there for partner

### When to Slow Down

**Consider slowing if:**
- Existing relationship is suffering
- Partner is genuinely struggling
- You're spread too thin
- Balance has been lost

### When Not to Slow Down

**Don't slow just because:**
- Partner is jealous (address jealousy, not your dating)
- It seems "unfair" (life isn't always fair)
- Partner wants equal without working for it
- Guilt alone

---

## Structural Solutions

### Agreements About Pace

**Some couples:**
- Agree to pace together (both slow down initially)
- Let each pursue their own pace
- Check in about impact
- Adjust as needed

### Time Agreements

**Consider:**
- Maximum nights out per week
- Protected couple time
- Balance rather than matching
- What works for your relationship

### Support Structures

**Build in:**
- Regular check-ins about feelings
- Support when needed
- Flexibility for circumstances
- Ongoing communication

## FAQ

**Is it fair if one partner dates more?**
Fair doesn't mean equal. Different people have different experiences. What matters is that both feel supported.

**Should the more-dating partner slow down?**
Not necessarily. Unless existing relationship is suffering, slowing due to asymmetry alone may create resentment.

**How do I stop feeling jealous of my partner's dating success?**
Work on the jealousy (therapy, self-reflection, communication), not by limiting partner. Your worth isn't determined by matches.

**What if asymmetry is causing real problems?**
Honest conversation about impact, what each needs, and potential adjustments. Sometimes professional help (ENM-aware therapist) assists.
