## The Four Attachment Styles

### Secure Attachment

**Characteristics:**
- Comfortable with intimacy and independence
- Trust comes relatively easily
- Can self-soothe during partner's absence
- Relationships feel stable, not anxious
- Can handle partner's other connections without excessive distress

**In ENM:** Secure attachment makes poly easier, but doesn't eliminate all challenges.

### Anxious Attachment

**Characteristics:**
- Craves closeness, fears abandonment
- Sensitive to changes in partner's attention
- May feel anxious when partner is with others
- Seeks frequent reassurance
- Can be hypervigilant about relationship status

**In ENM:** May struggle with jealousy, fear of replacement, and need for constant reassurance.

### Avoidant Attachment

**Characteristics:**
- Values independence highly
- Uncomfortable with too much closeness
- May withdraw when things get intense
- Downplays need for connection
- Can seem emotionally distant

**In ENM:** May use multiple relationships to avoid deep intimacy, struggle with partner's attachment needs.

### Disorganized Attachment (Fearful-Avoidant)

**Characteristics:**
- Push-pull dynamic with intimacy
- Both wants and fears closeness
- Can be unpredictable
- Often linked to trauma history
- May have intense relationships with dramatic swings

**In ENM:** Complex challenges—may seek many connections but struggle with stability in all of them.

## How Different Styles Interact

### Anxious + Avoidant

**The classic difficult pairing:**
- Anxious person pursues

**In poly:** This dynamic can play out across multiple relationships simultaneously.

### Anxious + Anxious

**What happens:**
- Both need a lot of reassurance
- Can either support each other or exhaust each other
- May compete for relationship security
- High emotional intensity

**In poly:** May struggle with jealousy together, or understand each other's needs.

### Avoidant + Avoidant

**What happens:**
- May keep comfortable distance
- Can parallel-play relationships
- May lack deep intimacy
- Lower conflict but also lower connection

**In poly:** May function smoothly on surface but lack depth.

### Secure + Any Style

**What helps:**
- Secure partner can model healthy attachment
- Provides stability for less secure partner
- Can help regulate the relationship system
- Secure attachment can be learned

## FAQ

**Can people with insecure attachment be poly?**
Yes, but it requires extra work. Poly can actually be healing with the right partners and self-awareness, or it can exacerbate existing wounds.

Not necessarily, but they need supportive partners, good agreements, and probably therapy to work on attachment while practicing ENM.

Yes, if you're not working on them. Poly can intensify attachment patterns. But it can also provide healing experiences if navigated thoughtfully.

Take a validated attachment style assessment, reflect on your relationship patterns, or work with a therapist who can help you identify yours.
