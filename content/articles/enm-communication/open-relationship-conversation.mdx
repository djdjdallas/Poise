Bringing up the idea of opening your relationship is one of the most anxiety-inducing conversations you can have. You're asking your partner to reconsider a fundamental assumption about your relationship.

This guide helps you approach this conversation thoughtfully, giving it the best chance of going well—whatever "well" means for your situation.

---

## Before You Bring It Up

### Get Clear on Your Why

Before talking to your partner, understand yourself:
- Why do you want this? (Be honest with yourself)
- Is there something missing in your current relationship?
- Are you interested in someone specific?
- Is this about curiosity, identity, or unmet needs?

Your partner will ask. Have genuine answers.

### Know What You're Asking For

"Open relationship" means different things:
- Occasional sexual encounters?
- Ongoing additional relationships?
- Full polyamory with multiple loves?
- Something specific (threesomes, swinging)?

The more specific you can be, the better the conversation.

### Consider the Timing

**Good times:**
- When you're both relaxed and connected
- After a positive experience together
- When there's time to talk without interruption
- When the relationship is stable

**Bad times:**
- During conflict or right after a fight
- When you're attracted to someone specific (they'll feel threatened)
- When major life stressors are happening
- When you're about to leave town or be apart

### Check Your Expectations

Understand:
- This may be a hard "no" for them
- They may need time to process
- Their initial reaction may not be their final answer
- This conversation might change things regardless of outcome

## How to Start the Conversation

### Setting It Up

Don't ambush. Signal that you want to talk about something important:
> "I've been thinking about something I want to share with you. Can we find time this weekend to talk?"

### Opening the Conversation

Lead with care for the relationship:
> "I love what we have and I'm not looking to replace it. I've been doing some thinking about our relationship and I want to share something vulnerable with you."

### Framing It Right

**Don't:** "I want an open relationship" (demand)
**Do:** "I've been curious about non-monogamy and I want to explore this conversation with you" (invitation)

**Don't:** "I've been feeling trapped" (blame)
**Do:** "I've been reflecting on what I might want in addition to what we have" (ownership)

## What to Say

### Script Starter

> "This is hard for me to bring up because I don't want you to feel like something's wrong with us or with you. I've been reading/thinking about ethical non-monogamy and I'm curious whether it's something we might ever explore. I'm not sure exactly what I want—I just know I want to talk about it honestly with you."

### Key Points to Cover

1. **Why you're interested** (honestly)
2. **What it doesn't mean** (not leaving, not dissatisfied)
3. **That you're open to their feelings** about it
4. **That you're not demanding** anything
5. **That the relationship matters** to you

### If There's Someone Specific

If you're interested in someone specific, decide whether to disclose:

**Disclosing:** Honest, but may make partner feel threatened
**Not disclosing:** May feel dishonest if discovered later

If you've already acted on feelings—even emotionally—you need to disclose. Seeking permission for something that's already happening is manipulation.

## Handling Their Reaction

### If They're Shocked

- Don't backtrack immediately
- Give them space to react
- Validate their feelings
- Clarify it's a discussion, not an ultimatum
- Offer to pause and return to it later

### If They're Hurt

Common hurt reactions:
- "Am I not enough?"
- "Are you cheating?"
- "Have you wanted this all along?"

Respond with reassurance:
> "This isn't about you being lacking. It's about me sharing something I'm curious about. Your feelings make complete sense."

### If They're Angry

- Don't escalate
- Acknowledge their reaction is valid
- Don't demand they be calm about it
- Offer space if needed
- Commit to continued conversation when ready

### If They're Open/Curious

- Don't get ahead of yourself
- Explore what they're curious about
- Discuss what this might look like
- Move slowly, even if they seem receptive
- Revisit the conversation multiple times before acting

## After the Initial Conversation

### Give It Time

This likely won't be resolved in one talk:
- Schedule follow-up conversations
- Give them resources if they want (books, articles)
- Let them process at their pace
- Don't pressure for a quick decision

### Continue the Dialogue

Questions to explore together:
- What would we each need to feel safe?
- What boundaries would be important?
- What are our fears? How do we address them?
- How would we handle jealousy?
- What would be off-limits?

### Recommended Resources

Books that might help:
- *The Ethical Slut* by Hardy and Easton
- *Opening Up* by Tristan Taormino
- *Polysecure* by Jessica Fern

## If They Say No

### Respecting Their Answer

A "no" is a valid response:
- Don't pressure, guilt, or manipulate
- Don't make them feel broken for wanting monogamy
- Accept that this might be a fundamental incompatibility
- Consider whether you can be genuinely happy monogamously

### What You Can Do

- Accept the no gracefully
- Explore what's beneath your desire (maybe needs can be met other ways)
- Consider couples therapy to explore the topic together
- Make a genuine choice: relationship or exploration

### If It's a Dealbreaker

Sometimes you can't both have what you need:
- This is a genuine incompatibility
- Neither person is wrong
- Ending the relationship may be the ethical path
- Staying while resentful helps no one

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't:

- Issue ultimatums ("open or I leave")
- Bring it up after meeting someone you want
- Pressure for an immediate answer
- Dismiss their concerns
- Make them feel abnormal for wanting monogamy
- Minimize how significant this is

### Do:

- Lead with care and vulnerability
- Accept their initial reaction
- Give genuine space to process
- Be willing to hear "no"
- Move slowly even if they say yes
- Treat this as ongoing dialogue, not one conversation
