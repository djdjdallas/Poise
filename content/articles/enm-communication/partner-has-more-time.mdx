Your partner is going on multiple dates per week. You haven't had a date in months. The imbalance is real, and it's affecting you.

Here's how to navigate when one partner has significantly more dating time, energy, or opportunities than the other.

---

## Why Time Imbalances Happen

### Work and Schedule Differences

**Common scenarios:**
- One partner works from home; one commutes
- Different work hours (9-5 vs. nights/weekends)
- One has a demanding career; one has flexibility
- Different amounts of PTO or free time

### Life Circumstances

**Other factors:**
- Childcare responsibilities falling unevenly
- One partner has health limitations
- Different social energy levels (introvert/extrovert)
- Geographic constraints (one lives in dating desert)

### Market Realities

**Dating app dynamics:**
- Women often get more matches than men
- Certain demographics have more options
- Attractiveness privilege is real
- Some people are better at converting matches to dates

### Existing Commitments

**Relationship bandwidth:**
- One partner already has more partners
- Different capacity for emotional labor
- One is saturated; one has room to grow
- Nesting partner dynamics

## The Feelings That Come Up

### Jealousy and Envy

**What you might feel:**
- Jealous of their dates
- Envious of their opportunities
- Resentful of the imbalance
- Frustrated that it's not "fair"

These feelings are valid, even if you intellectually believe in their freedom.

### Inadequacy

**Thoughts like:**
- "Why don't I get matches?"
- "What's wrong with me?"
- "They're more desirable than I am"
- "I'm not good enough"

The imbalance can become internalized as personal failure.

### Loneliness

**While they're out:**
- Alone at home during their dates
- Missing connection yourself
- Feeling left behind
- Wanting what they have

### Resentment

**Over time:**
- "It's not fair"
- "They don't understand"
- "Easy for them to be poly"
- Building frustration

---

## What Not to Do

### Don't Restrict Their Dating

**Tempting but harmful:**
- "You can only date when I have a date"
- "If I can't, you can't"
- Punishing them for your lack of opportunities
- Creating artificial scarcity

**Why it doesn't work:**
- Breeds resentment
- Doesn't address underlying issues
- Poly isn't about keeping score
- Their opportunities aren't causing your lack

### Don't Pretend You're Fine

**If you're not:**
- Suppressing feelings leads to explosions
- Resentment builds silently
- Your partner can't support what they don't know
- Honesty is essential

### Don't Make It Their Problem to Solve

**They can't:**
- Give you dates
- Make you more desirable
- Fix the dating market
- Create opportunities for you

They can support you, but they can't do the work for you.

### Don't Compare Constantly

**Scorekeeping damages relationships:**
- "You've had 5 dates this month, I've had 0"
- Tracking creates competition
- Comparison is the thief of joy
- Each person's journey is different

---

## Healthy Approaches

### Acknowledge the Imbalance

**Start with honesty:**
> "I'm struggling with how different our dating experiences are right now. I want to talk about it, not to limit you, but because I need support."

Naming it reduces its power.

### Separate Their Success From Your Struggle

**Two different issues:**
- Their dating life is their business
- Your dating life is your business
- Their success isn't causing your struggle
- You can support them while working on yourself

### Focus on What You Can Control

**In your control:**
- Quality of your dating profiles
- Effort you put into messaging
- Working on yourself (therapy, confidence, interests)
- How you spend your time when alone

**Not in your control:**
- How many matches you get
- Other people's responses
- The dating market
- Your partner's opportunities

### Ask for Support, Not Solutions

**What might help:**
- Extra reassurance during this time
- Quality time together that's not about dating
- Acknowledgment that the imbalance is hard
- Help with profile optimization (if wanted)

## Conversations to Have

### Expressing Your Feelings

**Script:**
> "I want to share something vulnerable. I've been feeling [jealous/envious/inadequate] watching you have dating success while I'm struggling. I'm not asking you to change anything—I just need you to know what I'm going through."

### Asking for Support

**Script:**
> "When you're going on dates and I'm home alone, I feel [lonely/left out]. It would help me if we could [specific request—text during the evening, have quality time the next day, etc.]."

### Discussing Fairness

**Script:**
> "I know poly isn't about keeping score, but the imbalance is hard for me. Can we talk about how we handle this? I don't want to restrict you, but I need to feel like we're in this together."

### When You Need More

**Script:**
> "I'm realizing I need more [time together/reassurance/emotional support] during this phase. What feels doable to you?"

## Practical Strategies

### Invest in Yourself

**Use the time productively:**
- Work on hobbies and interests

The goal isn't to distract from feelings but to build a full life.

### Improve Your Dating Game

**If you want more dates:**
- Get profile feedback from friends or communities
- Work with a dating coach
- Take better photos

### Build Community

**Beyond romantic connections:**
- ENM/poly meetups and communities
- Friendships with other poly people
- Support groups (online or local)
- Activities that bring connection

### Examine Your Expectations

**Ask yourself:**
- Do I actually want more dates, or am I comparing?
- What would be enough for me?
- Am I on dating apps for the right reasons?
- What am I really seeking?

## When the Imbalance Is Long-Term

### Reassess Expectations

**Questions to ask:**
- Is this imbalance temporary or structural?
- What would make this sustainable for me?
- Do we need to renegotiate our relationship structure?
- Is polyamory working for both of us?

### Consider Structural Changes

**Possibilities:**
- Different time allocation (more couple time)
- Different relationship configurations
- Adjustments to living situations
- Changes to how dating is approached

### Get Support

**When it's ongoing:**
- Therapy (individual or couples)
- Poly-friendly relationship coaching
- Support from ENM community
- Books and resources on poly challenges

## FAQ

**Is it okay to ask them to date less?**
You can share your feelings, but limiting their freedom to address your insecurity usually backfires. Better to work on the underlying issues.

**What if the imbalance is making me reconsider polyamory?**
That's valid to explore. Poly isn't for everyone, and structural incompatibilities are real. Consider whether this is a temporary struggle or a sign of deeper misalignment.

**How do I not feel like a loser when they're getting dates?**
Their success isn't your failure. Work on your own journey without comparing. Easier said than done, but comparison will always make you miserable.

**What if they're not being sensitive about it?**
Have a direct conversation about what you need. They may not realize how their enthusiasm affects you.
