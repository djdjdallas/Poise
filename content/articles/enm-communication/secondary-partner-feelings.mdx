"I feel like I'm always second priority."

This is one of the most common—and most painful—experiences in polyamory, especially in hierarchical relationships. Whether you're officially a "secondary partner" or just feeling like one, these feelings are real and deserve attention.

This guide helps you understand what you're experiencing, communicate effectively, and decide what's right for you.

## Understanding the Feeling

### What "Feeling Secondary" Looks Like

- Plans with you get canceled for their primary
- You're not included in important moments
- Your needs seem less important than theirs
- You feel like an afterthought, not a priority
- The relationship can only grow so much
- You're kept separate from parts of their life

### Why It Happens

In hierarchical poly:
- Primary partners often have veto power
- Time and resources go to primary first
- Secondary relationships have built-in limits
- You may be "protected against" rather than welcomed

But it also happens in non-hierarchical relationships:
- Longer relationships get momentum/inertia
- Nesting partners have logistical advantages
- NRE fades while established relationships feel stable
- Unconscious hierarchy despite stated values

## Is It the Structure or the Behavior?

### Structural Hierarchy

Some polyamorous relationships are explicitly hierarchical:
- Primary partner has priority
- Secondary relationships have defined limits
- This is agreed upon upfront

If you agreed to a secondary role, feeling secondary is... expected. The question becomes: is this working for you?

### Behavioral Hierarchy

Other times, the structure says "non-hierarchical" but behavior says otherwise:
- They claim equal treatment but always prioritize one person
- Lip service to your importance without follow-through
- Your needs get rationalized away

This disconnect is particularly painful.

### Questions to Clarify

- Was hierarchy explicit from the start?
- Are my expectations reasonable given the structure?
- Is my partner following their own stated values?
- Am I being treated as agreed, or worse?

## Communicating Your Feelings

### Before the Conversation

Get clear on:
- Specific situations that triggered these feelings
- What you actually need
- What's realistic given the relationship structure
- Whether your needs can be met here

### How to Bring It Up

**Avoid:** "You always put them first" (accusation)
**Try:** "I've been feeling like a lower priority lately and I want to talk about it" (ownership)

### What to Say

Framework: Situation + Feeling + Need

> "When our plans got canceled last week for something with [primary partner] [situation], I felt unimportant and like I don't matter as much [feeling]. I need to feel like our time together is protected [need]."

### Specific Requests

Vague needs are hard to meet. Try:
- "Can we have at least one guaranteed night a week?"
- "I need 24 hours notice if plans change, not last minute"
- "I want to be considered for [specific event/holiday]"
- "I'd like to meet your friends/family at some point"

## What Your Partner Can Do

### Realistic Changes

They can:
- Protect your scheduled time
- Communicate proactively about conflicts
- Validate your feelings
- Show appreciation and prioritization
- Include you more in their life
- Advocate for you with their other partner

### What They Can't Do

They probably can't:
- Make you a primary partner overnight
- Abandon agreements with established partners
- Fix your insecurity for you
- Give you more than they have

### Red Flags in Their Response

- Dismissing your feelings
- Making you feel guilty for having needs
- Promising change without action
- Blaming you for struggling with the structure
- Claiming hierarchy doesn't exist while practicing it

## Evaluating the Relationship

### Questions for Yourself

1. What did I agree to, and is that being honored?
2. Are my needs realistic for this type of relationship?
3. Is my partner doing their best within real constraints?
4. Am I getting enough of what I need to feel good?
5. Is this structure working for me, regardless of their behavior?

### When the Structure Is the Problem

Sometimes the issue isn't your partner's behavior—it's that hierarchical poly doesn't meet your needs:
- You want a relationship that can fully grow
- You need to be someone's primary
- You can't thrive in a secondary role
- You want more than this structure allows

This isn't a failure. It's incompatibility.

### When the Behavior Is the Problem

Other times, the structure could work, but:
- Your partner isn't following their own agreements
- They're treating you worse than the structure requires
- Their other partner is controlling your relationship
- They're not advocating for you appropriately

This is worth addressing—and may be fixable.

## Your Options

### 1. Accept the Structure

If you can genuinely make peace:
- Adjust expectations
- Focus on what you do get
- Build fulfillment elsewhere (friends, other partners, solo life)
- Find gratitude for what the relationship offers

Only works if acceptance is genuine, not suppressed resentment.

### 2. Negotiate Changes

If there's room for growth:
- Ask for specific changes
- Give your partner time to adjust
- Evaluate if change actually happens
- Revisit regularly

### 3. Seek Additional Relationships

If one relationship can't meet all needs:
- Find other connections that offer what this one can't
- Build a poly network that balances out
- Don't put all your eggs in one basket

### 4. End the Relationship

If it's not working:
- You're allowed to leave
- "Secondary" doesn't mean you settle for crumbs
- Your needs matter even if this relationship can't meet them

## Self-Worth in Polyamory

### Remembering Your Value

Being someone's secondary doesn't make you:
- Less worthy
- Less important as a person
- Disposable
- Lucky to have anything at all

You have intrinsic worth regardless of relationship position.

### Building Security

Beyond this relationship:
- Maintain friendships and community
- Have your own fulfilling life
- Don't stake all your self-worth on one relationship
- Practice self-compassion
