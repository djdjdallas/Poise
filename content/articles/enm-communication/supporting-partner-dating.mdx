## FAQ

**What if I'm struggling to be supportive?**
Acknowledge it, work on it, get support for yourself. It's okay to struggle—just don't punish your partner.

**How much support is reasonable?**
Enough to make them feel encouraged, not so much you're neglecting yourself. Balance matters.

**What if I don't like who they're dating?**
Unless there are safety concerns, their dating choices are theirs. You can share concerns once, then support their decisions.

**What if they're not supportive of my dating?**
This should be reciprocal. Address the imbalance directly. ENM requires mutual support.
