Dating apps ask for labels. ENM has many. How do you pick the right one, and what do you write when labels don't quite fit?

Here's a guide to navigating relationship labels on dating apps.

---

## Why Labels Matter (and Don't)

### Why They Matter

- **Filtering:** People search for specific relationship styles
- **Signaling:** Labels communicate basic compatibility
- **Efficiency:** Avoids explaining from scratch every time
- **Community:** Connects you with like-minded people

### Why They're Limited

- **Nuance:** No label captures everything
- **Evolution:** Your style may change
- **Assumptions:** Labels come with baggage
- **Variety:** Same label means different things to different people

### The Balance

Use labels as starting points, not complete definitions. They open conversations that then go deeper.

## Common Relationship Style Labels

### Polyamorous

**What it generally means:**
- Open to multiple romantic relationships
- With knowledge and consent of all involved
- Can include various structures

**What to know:**
- Most recognized ENM term
- Includes hierarchical and non-hierarchical variants
- Range from dating multiple to having multiple committed partners

**When to use it:**
You're open to multiple romantic relationships, not just sexual ones.

### Open Relationship

**What it generally means:**
- Primary partnership exists
- Sexual openness outside the primary relationship
- Often less romantic involvement with others

**What to know:**
- Sometimes implies hierarchy
- Focus often on sexual connections
- Primary relationship stays central

**When to use it:**
You have a primary partner and you're open to connections (often sexual) outside that partnership.

### Ethically Non-Monogamous (ENM)

**What it generally means:**
- Umbrella term for all consensual non-monogamy
- Includes poly, open, swinging, and more
- Emphasizes ethical component

**What to know:**
- Broad and inclusive
- Good if you don't fit specific categories
- May require more explanation

**When to use it:**
You're non-monogamous but don't identify with more specific labels, or you're exploring what fits.

### Solo Polyamory

**What it generally means:**
- Polyamorous without a primary partnership
- Prioritizes autonomy and independence
- May have multiple significant relationships

**What to know:**
- Distinct from "single and poly"
- Intentional structure, not transitional state
- Values sovereignty within relationships

**When to use it:**
You practice polyamory and intentionally don't have or want a primary partner structure.

### Relationship Anarchist

**What it generally means:**
- Rejects hierarchy between relationship types
- Each relationship defined on its own terms
- May or may not be romantic/sexual

**What to know:**
- Philosophy more than structure
- Less commonly understood
- May need more explanation

**When to use it:**
You don't prioritize romantic relationships over others and build all connections intentionally.

### Single

**What it generally means:**
- Not currently in a relationship
- May be seeking relationships
- Often implies looking for monogamy

**What to know:**
- On ENM apps, single takes different meaning
- Can be combined with other labels
- May need clarification about what you're seeking

**When to use it:**
You don't have current partners and want to indicate availability. Add clarification about ENM.

### Partnered

**What it generally means:**
- Have at least one partner
- Seeking additional connections
- Existing relationship acknowledged

**What to know:**
- Important to disclose
- Questions about structure may follow
- Pairs well with other labels

**When to use it:**
You have a partner and are seeking connections. Combine with other labels for clarity.

### Married

**What it generally means:**
- Legally married
- Seeking outside relationships
- Spouse presumably aware

**What to know:**
- High transparency
- Questions about spouse's involvement may follow
- Some people filter for or against

**When to use it:**
You're married and that's relevant to share. Clarify spouse's awareness and involvement.

## Platform-Specific Options

### Feeld

Feeld offers many options:
- Single, Partnered, Married
- Various interest and desire tags
- Room for description

**Strategy:** Use the closest label, then clarify in your bio.

### Other Apps

Different platforms have different options:
- OkCupid: Extensive options
- Hinge: More limited
- Tinder: Very limited

**Strategy:** Work within platform constraints; use bio/description space to clarify.

## When Labels Don't Fit

### What to Do

1. **Pick the closest:** Choose the label that's approximately right
2. **Clarify in bio:** Use your description to add nuance
3. **Address in conversation:** Explain more when chatting

### Examples of Clarification

**If "polyamorous" is close but not quite:**
> "Polyamorous, specifically non-hierarchical. I don't do primary/secondary distinctions."

**If you're still exploring:**
> "Exploring ENM—figuring out what structure works for me. Happy to discuss."

**If your style is unique:**
> "My relationship style doesn't fit neatly into labels. I'm [brief description of your actual approach]."

## Writing Your Relationship Style Description

### The Formula

1. Label (if applicable)
2. What that means for you
3. What you're seeking
4. Anything important to clarify

### Examples

**Solo poly:**
> "Solo poly—I don't have or want a primary partner. Looking for meaningful connections with other independent-minded people."

**Partnered and open:**
> "Partnered, open for independent dating. My partner and I date separately. Looking for ongoing connections, not just hookups."

**Relationship anarchist:**
> "Relationship anarchist—I don't prioritize relationships by category. Each connection is defined by the people in it. Currently seeking [what you're seeking]."

**New to ENM:**
> "New to ENM and exploring what fits. Curious about polyamory but taking it slow. Looking for patient, experienced connections."

**Complex situation:**
> "Married, dating independently with full knowledge and support. I have a long-distance partner as well. Looking for local connections with room to grow."

## Common Questions About Labels

### "What if people assume wrong from my label?"

That's why you clarify in bio and conversation. Labels are starting points, not complete pictures.

### "Should I use multiple labels?"

If they fit and the platform allows, yes. "Solo poly, relationship anarchist" gives more information than either alone.

### "What if I don't know my label yet?"

Use "ENM" or "Exploring ENM." Being honest about exploration is valid.

### "Do I have to use a label?"

You don't have to, but it helps people find you. A custom description works too.

---

## Having the Conversation

### When Asked "What Do You Mean By [Label]?"

> "For me, being [label] means [brief explanation of what it looks like in practice for you]."

### When Your Label Confuses Someone

> "I know that label can mean different things. What it means for me is [specifics]."

### When Exploring Further

> "I'm curious what [label] means to you? I want to make sure we're on the same page."

## Labels and Partners

### Coordinating With Existing Partners

If partnered, align on:
- How you each describe your relationship status
- How you describe each other (if at all)
- What labels you each use

### Respecting Partners' Privacy

Your labels should be honest without exposing partners more than they want:
- "Partnered" is true without identifying them
- Discuss what level of detail is okay to share
- Check in about changes to how you describe things

---

## The Evolution of Labels

### Labels Change

Your relationship style might evolve:
- Started open, now poly
- Was hierarchical, now non-hierarchical
- Had a partner, now solo

**Update your labels as you change.**

### The Label Landscape Changes

ENM terminology evolves:
- New terms emerge
- Old terms shift meaning
- What's understood changes over time

**Stay current with how language is used.**
