## FAQ

**How do I avoid bringing conflict from one relationship into another?**
Take time to process between. Don't use one partner to vent about another. Compartmentalize where possible while staying authentic.

**What if we can't agree?**
Some issues require compromise, others might be incompatibilities to accept. If you truly can't agree, consider if it's a dealbreaker.

**Is conflict a sign poly isn't working?**
No—conflict happens in all relationships. How you handle it matters more than avoiding it entirely.

**When should I give up on resolving something?**
When the same issue recurs despite genuine effort, when one person won't engage, or when the relationship is causing more harm than good.
