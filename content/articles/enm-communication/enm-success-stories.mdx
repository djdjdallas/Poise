## What Success Isn't

### The Myth of Constant Happiness

**Unrealistic expectations:**
- No one is ever jealous
- All metamours are best friends
- Every relationship is thriving simultaneously
- Perfect communication always
- Constant excitement and fulfillment

**Why this fails:**
- Sets impossible standard
- Makes normal struggles feel like failure
- Ignores the work involved
- Creates shame when reality differs

### The Quantity Myth

**Success isn't:**
- Having the most partners
- Dating constantly
- Always seeking new connections
- A full polycule

**Success is:**
- Having relationships that work for you
- Whatever number of partners fits your life
- Quality over quantity
- Sustainable configuration

## FAQ

**I've been poly for years and still struggle. Am I failing?**
No. Struggles are part of ENM at every stage. Success isn't the absence of challenges—it's having the tools and relationships to work through them.

**Does successful ENM always look complex?**
Not at all. Some of the most successful poly people have simple configurations. Complexity isn't a measure of success.

**What if my ENM doesn't look like what I see online?**
Social media shows highlight reels. Your reality doesn't have to match anyone else's presentation to be valid and successful.

**Can ENM success include eventually becoming monogamous?**
Yes. If poly taught you what you needed and you chose mono afterward, that's a valid outcome. Success is finding what works.
