You need to tell your date you're ENM. Whether they're from a mainstream app or you just haven't discussed it yet, the conversation needs to happen.

Here's how to have it well.

---

## When to Disclose

### The Golden Rule

Disclose before they're emotionally invested under false assumptions.

**Best practice:** Before the first date or at the very beginning of it.

### If You Met on Feeld/ENM App

They likely already know. But confirm:
> "Just to make sure we're on the same page—I'm polyamorous/in an open relationship. That came through from my profile, right?"

### If You Met Elsewhere

Disclose before investing significant time:
- On the app before meeting
- At the very start of the date
- Before any physical intimacy

**Not acceptable:** Waiting until they've caught feelings or you've hooked up.

## Framing the Conversation

### Setting It Up

**Create space for it:**
> "There's something I want to share with you that's important for you to know early on."

**Keep it natural:**
> "So, one thing I should mention about my dating life..."

**Be direct:**
> "Before we go further, I want to be upfront that I practice ethical non-monogamy."

### What to Include

**The basic facts:**
- That you're ENM
- Your structure (partnered, solo poly, etc.)
- What you're looking for

**Not required initially:**
- Full relationship history
- Every detail of your agreements
- Defense of ENM as a concept

## Scripts by Situation

### Script 1: You Have a Partner

> "I want to be upfront with you—I have a partner and we're in an open relationship. We date separately, and they know I'm here tonight. I'm looking for [what you're looking for]. Is that something you'd be open to?"

### Script 2: Solo Poly

> "I should mention that I practice polyamory. I'm not currently partnered, but I date multiple people and don't practice monogamy. I wanted you to know that before we go any further."

### Script 3: Newly Open

> "I want to be honest with you—I'm married/partnered, and we've recently opened our relationship. This is new for me, but my partner fully knows and supports me being here."

### Script 4: It's on Your Profile but Unclear

> "I know my profile mentioned being open, but I wanted to make sure we're clear on what that means. I have a partner and we date other people separately. Is that something you're comfortable with?"

### Script 5: More Casual Framing

> "So just to put it out there—I'm polyamorous. I have [a partner/other relationships] and I don't do monogamy. Wanted to make sure you knew that upfront."

## What to Say After

### If They Have Questions

**Common questions and answers:**

**"What does that mean exactly?"**
> "For me, it means [explain your specific structure]. I have the freedom to date and form relationships with multiple people, all with honesty and consent from everyone involved."

**"Does your partner know about me?"**
> "Yes, absolutely. They know I'm on a date tonight. We're open and honest about our other relationships."

**"Aren't you just cheating?"**
> "I understand why you might think that, but the difference is consent and honesty. Everyone involved knows and agrees. There's no deception."

**"What are you looking for?"**
> "I'm looking for [be honest—connection, dating, something casual, something ongoing, etc.]. What about you?"

**"Could this ever become... more?"**
> "That depends on what you mean by 'more.' I can offer [what you can offer]. I'm not going to leave my partner, but what I can offer is genuine. Is that something that might work for you?"

### If They Need Time

> "I understand this might be new information. Take whatever time you need to think about it. I'm happy to answer questions now or later."

---

## Handling Different Reactions

### Positive/Curious

They're interested or already know:
> "Great! I'm glad that's something you're open to. Any questions about how it works for me specifically?"

### Surprised but Open

They didn't expect it but aren't opposed:
> "I know it might not be what you expected. Happy to talk about it more if you have questions, or we can just see how the rest of the date goes and you can think on it."

### Hesitant

They have concerns:
> "I hear that you're hesitant. That's completely fair. Is there something specific that concerns you? I'm happy to talk through it."

### Negative

They're clearly not interested:
> "I understand this isn't for everyone. I appreciate you being honest about that. Should we call it here, or would you like to finish the evening as friends?"

### Hostile

They react badly:
> "I'm sorry you feel that way. I was being honest with you because I respect your ability to make informed decisions. I think we should end the date here."

Then leave. You don't owe them more explanation.

## What Not to Do

### Don't Apologize for Being ENM

**Not this:**
> "I'm sorry, but I have to tell you... I'm polyamorous. I hope that's okay."

**Instead:**
> "I'm polyamorous, and I wanted to be upfront about that."

ENM is a valid relationship style, not a confession.

### Don't Be Defensive

**Not this:**
> "Before you judge me, let me explain—"

**Instead:**
> "I practice ethical non-monogamy. Here's what that looks like for me..."

### Don't Oversell

**Not this:**
> "It's actually better than monogamy because studies show..."

**Instead:**
> State your facts and let them decide for themselves.

### Don't Hide Behind Philosophy

**Not this:**
> A 20-minute lecture on why monogamy is a social construct.

**Instead:**
> Clear information about your actual situation.

## If They Want to Proceed

### Next Steps

If they're open to exploring:
- Answer their questions
- Be clear about what you can offer
- Let things develop naturally
- Continue being honest

### Ongoing Disclosure

As things progress:
- Share more details as appropriate
- Be clear about boundaries and agreements
- Keep checking that they're genuinely okay
- Watch for signs they're just tolerating it

---

## If They Don't Want to Proceed

### Accept It Gracefully

> "I understand and I appreciate your honesty. No hard feelings."

### Don't Try to Convince Them

If they're not interested in ENM, respect that:
- Don't argue
- Don't minimize what you're asking
- Don't promise to change
- Don't make them feel guilty

### End the Date Well

> "Thank you for meeting me. I enjoyed our conversation. I hope you find what you're looking for."

---

## Special Situations

### If You Realize Mid-Date You Should Have Said Earlier

**Own it:**
> "I realize I should have mentioned this sooner—I'm in an open relationship. I apologize for not being clearer upfront. I understand if this changes things."

### If They Ask During the Date Before You've Said

**Be honest:**
> "Actually, yes, I'm in an open relationship. I was planning to tell you—glad you brought it up."

### If They Misunderstood Your Profile

**Clarify kindly:**
> "I think there might have been some confusion. When my profile said [X], I meant that I'm polyamorous. I have other relationships. Is that what you understood?"

---

## Building Confidence

### Practice Your Scripts

Say them out loud before dates:
- In the mirror
- To a friend
- Record yourself

The more natural it feels, the easier the conversation.

### Remember Why You're Disclosing

- Respect for their ability to make informed choices
- Foundation of honesty for any potential connection
- Alignment with your values
- No one's time wasted

### Know Your Worth

Your relationship style is valid. The right people will appreciate your honesty.
