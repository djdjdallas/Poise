If you've tried managing multiple relationships without a calendar system, you've probably experienced the chaos: double-bookings, forgotten dates, partner conflicts, and a constant sense of scrambling.

A good calendar system can save your sanity—and your relationships.

---

## Why You Need a System

### The Poly Scheduling Problem

Without a system:
- You'll double-book
- Partners will feel deprioritized
- You'll forget commitments
- Resentment builds
- Last-minute scrambling becomes constant

### What a Good System Does

- Makes your availability visible
- Prevents conflicts
- Shows partners they're prioritized
- Reduces cognitive load
- Creates accountability

## Setting Up Google Calendar

### Basic Setup

**Step 1:** Create your calendar (or use existing)
**Step 2:** Add secondary calendars for:
- Work
- Personal/self-care
- Each partner (if you want color-coding)

**Step 3:** Set up sharing based on your preferences

### Color-Coding Options

**Option A: Partner-based colors**
- Blue = Time with Partner A
- Green = Time with Partner B
- Purple = Time with Partner C
- Gray = Work
- Red = Personal/blocked

**Option B: Activity-based colors**
- Blue = Date nights
- Green = Casual hangouts
- Purple = Processing/talking time
- Orange = Travel/transition time

### What to Include

Don't just add dates. Add:
- **Travel time** to/from dates
- **Transition time** between partners
- **Processing time** after emotional conversations
- **Personal time** (blocked for you)
- **Tentative plans** (as tentative, not confirmed)

---

## Sharing Options

### What to Share (And With Whom)

| Sharing level | What they see | Good for |
|---------------|---------------|----------|
| **Full details** | All event names and details | Nesting partners, highly transparent relationships |
| **Free/busy only** | When you're available, not what for | Partners who want privacy but need to know availability |
| **No sharing** | Nothing | Parallel poly, high privacy needs |

### Sharing with Partners

How to share in Google Calendar:
1. Click calendar name → Settings
2. "Share with specific people"
3. Add their email
4. Choose permission level

### Privacy Considerations

Think about:
- Do partners want to see each other's names?
- Are any relationships more private?
- How much detail is helpful vs. overwhelming?
- Partner preferences about visibility

---

## System Options

### The Shared Calendar Approach

**How it works:**
- One calendar everyone can see
- Add your events, partners add theirs
- Conflicts visible immediately

**Pros:** Maximum transparency, easy coordination
**Cons:** Less privacy, can feel surveillance-y

### The Free/Busy Approach

**How it works:**
- Partners see when you're busy, not what you're doing
- They can request time in available slots

**Pros:** Balance of coordination and privacy
**Cons:** Requires more communication about specifics

### The Hub-Spoke Approach

**How it works:**
- You manage the calendar
- Partners check with you for availability
- You coordinate everything

**Pros:** Works for parallel poly, maintains privacy
**Cons:** More labor for you, partners less autonomous

## Practical Tips

### Build in Transitions

Don't back-to-back schedule:
- Physical transition time (travel)
- Emotional transition time (decompressing)
- Buffer for running late

Example: If a date ends at 10 PM and you need to be home, don't schedule another call at 10:15.

### Protect Recurring Time

Create standing appointments:
- Weekly date night with Partner A
- Thursday evenings with Partner B
- Sunday mornings solo

Recurring events create stability and prevent constant renegotiation.

### Handle Tentative Plans

For "maybe" plans:
- Use "tentative" status (question mark in Google Calendar)
- Add notes like "tentative – confirming Tuesday"
- Don't double-book around tentative events

### Plan Personal Time First

Before scheduling partner time:
- Block self-care time
- Add work commitments
- Include friend time
- Build in rest

Then distribute remaining time among partners.

---

## Communication Around Scheduling

### Booking Time

Approaches vary:
- **Open booking:** Partners add themselves to open slots
- **Request-based:** Partners ask, you confirm
- **Assigned slots:** Regular time is pre-determined

Choose based on your relationship structures and preferences.

### When Conflicts Happen

They will. Handle with:
- Early communication
- Fair resolution (who had it first? Who's more flexible?)
- Making it up to the affected partner
- Learning for next time

### Calendar Communication Scripts

**Requesting time:**
> "I'd love to see you this week. Looking at the calendar, Thursday or Saturday work on my end—any preference?"

**Declining due to conflict:**
> "I'd love to, but I already have plans with [partner]. Can we do [alternative day]?"

**When you need more time:**
> "I'm realizing I need more time blocked for myself this month. Can we look at the calendar together and figure out a sustainable rhythm?"

## Google Calendar Alternatives

### If Google Doesn't Work for You

- **Apple Calendar:** Similar features, Apple ecosystem
- **Outlook:** Works well for work integration
- **Calendly:** Great for booking-style scheduling
- **Fantastical:** Premium features, nice interface
- **Notion/Coda:** Customizable, can integrate other info

### Specialized Options

- **Poly.land calendar** (community tool)
- **Shared spreadsheets** (for the detail-oriented)
- **Physical wall calendars** (for nesting partners)

---

## Common Pitfalls

### What Goes Wrong

**Over-scheduling:** Filling every slot, no buffer
**Under-protecting personal time:** Partners get all free time
**Calendar creep:** Tentative becomes firm too easily
**Ignoring the calendar:** Making plans without checking
**Unequal visibility:** One partner sees more than others

### How to Avoid

- Schedule personal time first
- Check calendar before committing
- Review weekly for conflicts
- Be consistent with what you share
- Treat calendar commitments as real

---

## Getting Partners on Board

### If They're Skeptical

- Start simple (just share busy times)
- Show how it benefits them
- Let them set their privacy preferences
- Don't force total visibility

### If They're Not Tech-Savvy

- Help them set up
- Use simpler systems
- Be patient with learning curve
- Adapt system to their comfort
