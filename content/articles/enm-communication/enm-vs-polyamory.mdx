"ENM" and "polyamory" get used interchangeably sometimes, but they're not the same thing. If you're exploring non-monogamous relationships—or trying to describe yours—understanding the difference matters.

This guide explains both terms, how they relate to each other, and how to figure out which one (if either) describes what you're looking for.

## The Quick Answer

**Ethical Non-Monogamy (ENM)** is the umbrella term for any relationship structure where people consensually have multiple romantic or sexual connections.

**Polyamory** is a specific type of ENM focused on having multiple loving, romantic relationships simultaneously.

**In other words:** All polyamory is ENM, but not all ENM is polyamory.

## Understanding Ethical Non-Monogamy (ENM)

### What ENM Means

ENM describes any consensual non-monogamous relationship structure. The "ethical" part emphasizes:

- **Consent** - Everyone involved knows and agrees
- **Honesty** - No deception or cheating
- **Communication** - Ongoing dialogue about boundaries
- **Respect** - For everyone's autonomy and feelings

### Types of ENM

ENM includes many relationship styles:

| Style | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Polyamory** | Multiple romantic/loving relationships |
| **Open relationships** | Primary partnership + outside connections |
| **Swinging** | Recreational sex with others, often as couples |
| **Relationship anarchy** | Rejecting relationship hierarchies entirely |
| **Monogamish** | Mostly monogamous with occasional exceptions |
| **Solo poly** | Polyamory without a primary partner |

### ENM Is the Big Tent

If someone says they're "ENM," you know they're non-monogamous in some way, but you don't know the specifics. They could be:
- Swingers who only play together
- Polyamorous with multiple committed partners
- In an open relationship with casual outside connections
- Something else entirely

## Understanding Polyamory

### What Polyamory Means

Polyamory (from Greek "poly" meaning many and Latin "amor" meaning love) specifically refers to having multiple romantic, loving relationships simultaneously with everyone's knowledge and consent.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Love/romance focused** - Not just sex
- **Multiple relationships** - Not just one primary + casual
- **Ongoing** - Not one-time encounters
- **Emotional investment** - Deep connections, not just physical

### Polyamory ≠ Just Sex

The distinction from other ENM styles:
- Swingers might have sex with others but not form romantic bonds
- Open relationship folks might have casual connections but one primary love
- Polyamorous people form multiple loving relationships

### Polyamory Structures

Polyamory itself has variations:

**Hierarchical poly** - Primary partner(s) with secondary relationships
**Non-hierarchical poly** - All relationships valued without ranking
**Solo poly** - No primary partner, multiple independent relationships
**Kitchen table poly** - Metamours (partners' partners) interact socially
**Parallel poly** - Relationships stay more separate

## Key Differences

| Aspect | ENM (Umbrella) | Polyamory (Specific) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Scope** | Any consensual non-monogamy | Multiple loving relationships |
| **Focus** | Varies (sex, romance, both) | Romantic love |
| **Depth** | Can be casual or deep | Typically emotionally deep |
| **Commitment** | Varies | Usually committed relationships |
| **Identity** | Descriptive | Often an identity |

## Common Confusions

### "My Partner and I Are ENM" vs "We're Polyamorous"

**ENM might mean:**
- You swing together occasionally
- You have an open relationship
- You're polyamorous
- Something else

**Polyamorous specifically means:**
- You have (or want) multiple romantic relationships
- These are loving, not just sexual
- It's ongoing, not occasional

### "I'm ENM but Not Poly"

This is totally valid. Examples:
- "We're swingers—we play with others sexually but our romantic relationship is just us."
- "I'm in an open relationship—I have casual sex with others but only one romantic partner."
- "I'm monogamish—mostly monogamous with rare exceptions."

### "Is Swinging Polyamory?"

Generally no. Swinging typically involves:
- Recreational sex with others
- Often as a couple activity
- Without romantic/loving relationships forming
- Focused on physical rather than emotional

Unless romantic feelings develop (which can happen), swinging is ENM but not polyamory.

## Which Term Applies to You?

### You Might Be ENM (But Not Poly) If:

- You want to be sexually open but romantically exclusive
- You're interested in occasional play but not ongoing relationships
- You swing or have casual connections outside your partnership
- You're exploring but not sure what you want

### You Might Be Polyamorous If:

- You want (or have) multiple loving relationships
- You're interested in emotional depth with more than one person
- Casual sex alone doesn't describe what you're seeking
- You want ongoing committed relationships with multiple people

### You Might Be Both If:

- You're polyamorous (which is a type of ENM)
- Saying "ENM" is accurate but less specific
- Saying "polyamorous" is more precise about your style

## Why the Distinction Matters

### For Dating

When you say "I'm ENM," matches need more information:
- What kind of ENM?
- What are you looking for?
- What's your current situation?

When you say "I'm polyamorous," people understand:
- You want romantic relationships
- Multiple partners, not just one + casual
- Emotional connection matters

### For Communication

Clarity prevents misunderstandings:
- A swinger matching with someone poly might have misaligned expectations
- Someone seeking casual ENM might not want polyamory's emotional investment
- Using the right terms helps everyone find compatible matches

### For Self-Understanding

Knowing where you fit helps you:
- Find community and resources
- Explain yourself to potential partners
- Understand your own needs and boundaries
- Make better dating choices

### How to Signal Your Style

**On Feeld:**
- Select "Polyamory" Desire if that's accurate
- Select "Open relationship" if it's more casual ENM
- Your bio can clarify further

**In conversation:**
- Be specific early about what you're seeking
- Ask matches about their style too
- Don't assume "ENM" means the same thing to everyone

See our [Feeld desires guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-desires-explained) for more on signaling your relationship style.

---

## The Bottom Line

**ENM** = umbrella term for any consensual non-monogamy
**Polyamory** = specific type of ENM focused on multiple loving relationships

Both are valid. Neither is better. What matters is understanding what you want and communicating it clearly.
