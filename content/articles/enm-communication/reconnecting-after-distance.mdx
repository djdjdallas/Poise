## FAQ

**How do you know if distance is temporary or a sign of relationship problems?**
Distance that responds to reconnection efforts is often temporary. Distance that persists despite efforts may indicate deeper issues to address.

**What if my partner doesn't seem to notice the distance?**
Tell them. Your perception is valid. Maybe they process differently, or maybe they've been feeling it too.

**How long does reconnection take?**
Varies widely. Some reconnection happens quickly with intention. Deeper drifts take longer. Be patient and consistent.

**What if we try to reconnect and it doesn't work?**
That's important information about the relationship. Consider couples counseling or honest conversation about the future.
