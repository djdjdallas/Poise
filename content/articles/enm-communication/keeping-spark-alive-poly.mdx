The honeymoon phase doesn't last forever—in monogamy or polyamory. But poly adds unique challenges: NRE with new partners can make existing relationships feel stale, and dividing attention means less time for each connection.

Here's how to keep the spark alive in your poly relationships.

## The Poly-Specific Challenges

### NRE Comparison

**The trap:**
- New partner has exciting NRE
- Existing partner feels routine
- Comparison diminishes existing relationship
- New feels better, but it's brain chemistry

### Divided Attention

**With multiple partners:**
- Less exclusive focus
- Shared time and energy
- Potential for feeling less special
- Competition for romantic gestures

### Comfort vs. Complacency

**Long-term relationships:**
- Can become comfortable (good)
- Can become complacent (bad)
- Need intentional maintenance
- Easy to coast

## FAQ

**Is it normal for spark to fade in poly relationships?**
Yes—in any long-term relationship. It takes work to maintain. Poly adds NRE contrast but doesn't inherently cause more fading.

**How do I keep the spark when I barely have time for each partner?**
Quality over quantity. Make limited time intentional and connected. Express love between seeing each other.

**What if only one partner wants to work on the spark?**
Both partners need to be invested. If one isn't, that's a relationship conversation about priorities and commitment.

Often yes, with mutual effort. Sometimes relationships run their course. Honest assessment helps.
