"Unicorn hunter" is one of the worst labels you can earn in ENM spaces. But many couples get this reputation without understanding why—or how to do better.

Here's what unicorn hunting actually is, why it's harmful, and how couples can date ethically instead.

## What Is Unicorn Hunting?

### The Definition

Unicorn hunting is when a couple seeks a (typically bi woman) "third" in ways that:
- Prioritize the couple over the new person
- Treat the third as an addition, not an equal
- Impose rules that benefit the couple at the third's expense
- View the third as a fantasy fulfillment rather than a person

### Why "Unicorn"?

They're called unicorns because what couples want is so rare it's essentially mythical:
- Attractive to both partners equally
- Available for both but no one else
- No existing commitments that compete
- Happy to accept lesser status

These expectations are unrealistic and often harmful.

## Why It's Problematic

### Power Imbalance

The couple has:
- Established relationship
- Shared history and resources
- Unified front in disagreements
- Ability to "veto" the third

The "unicorn" has:
- Less relationship history
- No allies in conflicts
- Fewer protections
- Risk of being dropped by both at once

### Common Harms

**Disposability:**
When things get hard, couples often discard the third together.

**Lack of agency:**
Rules made by the couple often weren't negotiated with the third.

**Couple privilege:**
The existing relationship always takes priority.

**Emotional exploitation:**
Using someone for sex/excitement without real relationship investment.

## Signs You Might Be Unicorn Hunting

### Check Yourself

**Red flags in your approach:**
- You want one person to date both of you equally
- You have rules the third didn't help create
- Either of you can veto the third
- You're seeking a "third" rather than a "person"
- The third can't date others, but you have each other
- You discuss the third as adding to "your" relationship

**Language that signals unicorn hunting:**
- "Looking for our third"
- "Someone to join us"
- "We date as a package"
- "No drama, just fun"
- "Looking for a bi female for friendship and more"

### The Key Question

Ask yourself: "Would I date this person if my partner wasn't involved?"

If the answer is "no" or "I haven't thought about that," you may be seeking a sex toy with a pulse, not a partner.

## How to Date Ethically as a Couple

### Option 1: Date Separately

Most experienced poly people recommend this, especially starting out:
- Each person dates individuals
- Relationships develop naturally
- No pressure for everyone to connect
- Each relationship stands on its own

**Benefits:**
- Avoids most unicorn hunting dynamics
- Easier for new people to say yes to
- Builds individual relationship skills
- Less pressure all around

### Option 2: Date Together Ethically

If you both want to be involved, do it carefully:

**Treat the new person as an individual:**
- They're a person, not an addition
- Their needs matter as much as yours
- They should have voice in decisions
- Their other relationships are equally valid

**No couple veto:**
- Either of you can end your individual relationships
- Neither of you can force the other to end theirs
- The third should have same power

**Flexible structures:**
- Maybe they'll connect more with one of you
- That should be okay
- Forcing equal attraction is unrealistic

**Equal investment:**
- Time, energy, consideration
- They're not the "new" one forever
- Work toward relationship equality

## What Ethical Couple Dating Looks Like

### In Your Profile

**Instead of:**
> "Couple looking for unicorn for some fun"

**Try:**
> "We're [names/initials], partnered and dating separately/together. Each looking for genuine connections. Happy to chat individually or together—whatever feels comfortable."

### In Conversation

**Instead of:**
- Messaging only as a couple
- Making decisions as a unit
- Presenting a unified front

**Try:**
- Letting them get to know you individually
- Acknowledging you're each separate people
- Giving them space to connect differently with each of you

### In Practice

**Ethical couple dating means:**
- They can date others (you have each other, after all)
- They have voice in relationship rules
- They can connect more with one of you
- They're not "the third" forever
- Their feelings matter in decisions

## Scripts for Couples

### Addressing Unicorn Hunter Concerns

When someone seems hesitant:

> "I know couples on here can have a bad reputation. We want to be clear: we're not looking for someone to 'add to' our relationship. We're interested in getting to know you as an individual, seeing what connection develops naturally."

### Explaining Your Structure

> "We're partnered and we each date separately. Sometimes we're both interested in the same person, but there's no pressure for everyone to connect equally. We're open to whatever develops organically."

### When They Want to Date One of You

> "That's completely fine. Our relationships can look different. [Partner] and I don't need to be involved equally."

### When Things Get Complicated

> "We want to make sure you feel like an equal partner in decisions that affect you. What do you need from us to feel that way?"

## Navigating the Stigma

### Reality: Couples Face Skepticism

Even ethical couples encounter resistance because unicorn hunting is so common. Be patient with:
- People asking pointed questions
- Initial hesitation
- Needing to prove yourselves

### How to Earn Trust

- Be consistent in ethical behavior
- Don't get defensive about questions
- Demonstrate you value them as individual
- Give them time to see you're different

### Accept the Limitations

Some people won't date couples at all. That's their right. Don't:
- Try to convince them
- Get offended
- Argue about how you're different

Respect their boundary and move on.

## When You Realize You've Been Unicorn Hunting

### It's Okay to Learn

Many couples start out unicorn hunting without realizing it. If you recognize yourself:
- Don't spiral in shame
- Do acknowledge the problem
- Make concrete changes
- Apologize to anyone you've harmed

### Making Amends

If you've treated someone as a unicorn:

> "I've been reflecting on how I/we approached our connection, and I realize I/we treated you more as an addition than an equal. That wasn't fair to you. I'm sorry."

Then actually change your behavior.
