## FAQ

**Do I have to disclose neurodivergence to partners?**
Not required, but often helpful. It helps partners understand you and sets up the relationship for success.

**Is polyamory easier or harder for neurodivergent people?**
Both—the explicit communication can be easier, but the complexity and social demands can be harder. It depends on the individual.

**How do I find ND-friendly poly communities?**
Look for explicitly inclusive spaces, queer communities (high overlap), online groups, and events that mention accessibility.

**What if my neurodivergence is incompatible with what partners want?**
This is a compatibility issue, not a flaw in you. Some relationships won't work, and that's okay. Find partners whose needs align with what you can offer.
