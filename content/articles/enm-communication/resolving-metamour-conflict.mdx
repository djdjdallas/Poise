Conflict with a metamour is uniquely complicated—you're in conflict with someone you didn't choose, and your shared partner is caught in the middle. Handling these situations well protects all the relationships involved.

## Why Metamour Conflict Is Different

### You Didn't Choose Them

**Unlike partners:**
- They're in your life because of someone else
- No initial connection or chemistry
- May have very different values/styles
- Relationship exists by circumstance

### Shared Person in the Middle

**Your mutual partner:**
- Cares about both of you
- Affected by your conflict
- May feel torn
- Has limited ability to fix it

### Stakes Are High

**Unresolved conflict:**
- Affects your partner
- Can destabilize the network
- Creates ongoing stress
- May force difficult choices

**Open with:**
- "I'd like to talk about [specific issue]"
- "I've noticed some tension and want to address it"
- "I think we both want things to be better"
- "Can we find a way forward together?"

### Focus on Specific Issues

**Be specific:**

- What you need to be different
- Actionable changes

### Finding Middle Ground

**Work toward:**

## FAQ

**Do I have to get along with metamours?**
No. Parallel poly is valid. But basic civility makes everything easier.

**What if my partner takes their side?**
Have honest conversation about feeling unsupported. Your partner doesn't have to referee, but should support both relationships.

**Can my partner help resolve this?**
They can facilitate and support, but can't fix it for you. Resolution requires the people in conflict.

**What if they're genuinely problematic?**
Express concerns to your partner once, clearly. Their relationship choices are ultimately theirs.
