You're taking the step of moving in together—while maintaining polyamorous relationships. This changes things. Your partnership deepens, but other relationships need protection. Your home becomes shared space with implications for everyone.

Here's how to navigate becoming nesting partners intentionally.

## Before Moving In

### Is This the Right Step?

**Good reasons to cohabit:**
- You genuinely want to share daily life
- Practical benefits (financial, logistical)
- Deepening commitment you both want
- Ready for this level of entanglement

**Concerning reasons:**
- Pressure (internal or external)
- Avoiding ending other relationship
- Financial desperation
- Following the "relationship escalator" without thought

### The Big Conversations

**Before signing a lease:**
- What does this mean for our relationship hierarchy?
- How will other partners be welcomed in our home?
- What are expectations around privacy?
- How will we handle overnight guests?
- What happens if we break up?

### Impact on Other Relationships

**Consider:**
- How will this affect your other partners?
- Their access to you may change
- They may feel de-prioritized
- Have you talked to them about this?

**Conversations needed:**
- With other partners about the change
- About what they need during transition
- About how the new living situation affects them
- About their role going forward

## Designing Your Shared Space

### Space for Other Relationships

**Physical space considerations:**
- Is there a guest room for other partners?
- Where can you have privacy?
- Can partners feel comfortable visiting?
- Is the space welcoming to others?

**If space is limited:**
- Creative solutions needed
- Hotels/partners' places may be necessary
- Discuss logistics openly
- Budget for alternatives

### Boundaries in the Home

**Discuss and agree:**
- Can other partners sleep over? How often?
- Which spaces are shared vs. private?
- What about sex in shared spaces?
- Personal items from other relationships—where?
- What if nesting partner is uncomfortable?

### Making Others Welcome

**Your home shouldn't feel:**
- Off-limits to other partners
- Like they're intruding
- Uncomfortable or unwelcoming
- Like "your" space vs. the relationship's space

**What helps:**
- Clear guidelines everyone knows
- Welcoming attitude from both nesting partners
- Designated comfortable spaces
- Treating visitors with care

## Protecting Other Relationships

### Time Allocation

**Living together risk:**
- Nesting partner gets default time
- Other partners get scheduled time
- Imbalance feels unfair
- Quality vs. quantity issues

**Solutions:**
- Intentionally schedule time with non-nesting partners
- Don't let proximity create neglect
- Quality matters for all relationships
- Date your nesting partner too

### Maintaining Separateness

**Avoid enmeshment:**
- Keep some individual identity
- Maintain separate friendships
- Have activities apart
- Don't become "a unit" that excludes others

**For other partners:**
- Relationships should maintain their character
- Don't make everything about the nesting partnership
- They're dating you, not your household
- Keep those connections strong

### The Hierarchy Question

**Nesting creates descriptive hierarchy:**
- You share more practical life
- More daily interaction
- More logistics together
- This is reality, not necessarily prescription

**Avoid prescriptive hierarchy problems:**
- Nesting partner doesn't automatically get veto
- Other relationships still have validity
- Decisions should involve affected parties
- Commitment isn't only measured by cohabitation

## Navigating Daily Life

### Logistics with Other Partners

**Practical considerations:**
- When do you see other partners?
- How do you manage evenings out?
- Overnight planning
- Coming and going with consideration

**Communication:**

- Flexibility when possible

### When Nesting Partner is Home Alone

**Supporting them:**

- Don't curtail your time because of their discomfort

**What helps:**
- Build their own social life
- Hobbies and interests
- Other relationships of their own
- Self-soothing skills

### When You're the One Home

**Managing your feelings:**
- Your partner is out with someone else
- They'll come home to you
- Find security in that
- Build your own life too

**Avoid:**
- Waiting anxiously for them
- Demanding constant updates
- Making them feel guilty
- Acting cold when they return

## Financial Considerations

### Shared Expenses

**Discuss:**

- Travel to see other partners?
- Shared vs. individual finances?

**Common approaches:**

## FAQ

**Does moving in together mean that partner is more important?**
Not necessarily. It means you're sharing more practical life. Other relationships can be equally committed with different structures.

**Can I have overnight guests if my nesting partner is uncomfortable?**
This requires negotiation. Your other partners deserve time with you, but your nesting partner's comfort matters too. Find solutions that work for everyone.

**What if my other partners feel like they've been demoted?**
Address this directly. Ask what would help them feel valued. Make concrete changes to demonstrate their importance.

**Should we get a bigger place to have room for other partners?**
If you can afford it and both want it, yes. A guest room or extra space can make polyamory much easier logistically.
