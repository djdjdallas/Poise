Couples dating together have a reputation problem—and often, it's earned. But it doesn't have to be that way.

Here's how to date as a couple while treating everyone as a complete human being.

---

## The Problem Couples Create

### Why Couples Get a Bad Reputation

Common complaints from people dating couples:
- Treated as a fantasy, not a person
- Expected to like both equally
- Dropped as soon as complications arise
- Given no voice in the relationship
- Subject to rules they didn't create

### The "Unicorn Hunter" Label

This label sticks because the pattern is so common:
- Couple seeks attractive bi woman
- She must date both equally
- She can't date anyone else
- She has less power than either partner
- She's disposable when inconvenient

Even well-meaning couples can fall into these patterns unconsciously.

## The Foundation: Couple Privilege Awareness

### What Is Couple Privilege?

The built-in advantages an existing couple has:
- Established relationship and trust
- Shared history and resources
- Unified position in conflicts
- Ability to make decisions together (sometimes against the new person)
- Social and legal recognition

### Why It Matters

Couple privilege isn't evil—but it's powerful. Unchecked, it leads to:
- New partners feeling less-than
- Decisions made without their input
- Their needs consistently deprioritized
- Power imbalances that breed resentment

### What to Do About It

Awareness is the first step:
- Acknowledge your privilege
- Actively work against imbalances
- Give the new person voice and agency
- Don't use "we" against them

## Ethical Couple Dating Principles

### Principle 1: See People as People

**Not:**
- An addition to your relationship
- A sexual fantasy come to life
- Someone to "enhance" your bond
- Interchangeable with other potential thirds

**But:**
- A complete person with their own needs
- Someone with a full life outside you
- A potential partner, not a plaything
- Unique and irreplaceable

### Principle 2: Equal Value (If Not Identical Structure)

The new person may have different relationships with each of you. That's okay.

What they deserve:
- Voice in decisions that affect them
- Consideration of their needs
- Respect equal to what you give each other
- Genuine care for their wellbeing

### Principle 3: Flexible Expectations

**Don't require:**
- Equal attraction to both partners
- Identical relationship with each
- Exclusive commitment to your couple
- Adherence to your existing rules

**Do allow:**
- Organic connection development
- Different dynamics with each partner
- Their own outside relationships
- Renegotiation of agreements

### Principle 4: No Couple Veto

If either of you can "veto" the relationship:
- The new person has no security
- Their investment can be erased unilaterally
- They're fundamentally less powerful

Better approach:
- Each relationship stands on its own
- Either individual can end their relationship
- Neither can force the other to end theirs

## Practical Application

### How to Write Your Profile

**Instead of:**
> "Couple looking for our unicorn 🦄 Someone to join our relationship and have fun with us both!"

**Try:**
> "We're [names], partnered and dating together. We're looking to connect with someone who we could each build genuine relationships with. Open to what that looks like developing organically."

### How to Message

**Instead of:**
> "We think you're hot and would love to meet you!"

**Try:**
> "Hi! We both found your profile interesting. [Reference something specific]. Would you be open to chatting and seeing if we connect?"

### How to Handle Early Conversations

**Ask about them:**
- What are they looking for?
- What's their experience with couples?
- What concerns do they have?
- What would they need to feel comfortable?

**Share honestly:**
- Your relationship structure
- How you date together
- What you're seeking
- Your awareness of couple dynamics

### How to Date

**Both present:**
- Be individuals, not a unit
- Let them connect with each of you separately
- Don't speak for each other
- Make space for different relationships

**Individual connection:**
- Allow time one-on-one with each of you
- Nurture separate bonds
- Don't require both present always
- Let natural dynamics emerge

## Handling the Complexities

### When They Click More With One of You

**This happens often.** Don't panic.

**Options:**
- Let that relationship develop while maintaining friendship with the other
- Transition from triad to V structure
- Accept that equal connection isn't required
- Be flexible about what the relationship becomes

**What not to do:**
- Force equal time/connection
- Punish them for natural chemistry
- End everything because it's not the triad you imagined
- Make them feel guilty

### When Issues Arise

**Conflict resolution should include them:**
- Not: "We talked and decided..."
- But: "Can we all discuss this together?"

**Their voice matters:**
- In decisions that affect them
- In setting rules and boundaries
- In how the relationship develops
- In conflict resolution

### When Things Don't Work

**Ending ethically:**
- Don't just ghost or drop them
- Have an honest conversation
- Each person ends their own relationship
- Don't "fire" them together as a couple

## The Questions They Might Ask

### "What happens if you two fight?"

> "We work to handle our conflicts between us without letting them affect you. If something does impact you, we'd want to talk about it rather than putting you in the middle."

### "Do I have to like you both equally?"

> "No. We understand connections develop differently. We're open to what this looks like organically."

### "What if I develop stronger feelings for one of you?"

> "That's something we can navigate. We're not requiring a perfectly balanced triad—we're open to what works for everyone."

### "Can I date other people?"

> "Yes. We have each other; it wouldn't be fair to expect exclusivity from you when we can't offer it."

### "What are your rules?"

> "We have some agreements, and we'd want your input on anything that affects you. Rules that involve you should include your voice."

## Red Flags in Your Own Behavior

### Watch for These Signs

**You might be problematic if:**
- You talk about "our third" before meeting anyone
- You expect instant chemistry with both of you
- Your partner's approval is required for everything
- The new person has no input on "the rules"
- You see them primarily as enhancing your couple relationship
- They can't have other partners but you have each other

### Check In With Yourself

**Ask:**
- Am I treating them the way I'd want to be treated?
- Do they have real voice and agency?
- Would an outside observer see imbalance?
- Am I seeing them as a full person or a role to fill?
