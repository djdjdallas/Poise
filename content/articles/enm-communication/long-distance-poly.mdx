## FAQ

**How often should we talk?**
Whatever works for both of you. Some couples want daily video calls; others are happy with weekly check-ins and texting. Find your rhythm.

**How often should we visit?**
Depends on distance, finances, and schedules. Monthly visits work for some, quarterly for others. More important than frequency is consistency and quality.

**Can LDR poly really work long-term?**
Yes, but both people need to actively choose it. LDR works when it's what you both want, not when it's tolerated.

**What if I want to close the distance but they don't?**
This is a fundamental compatibility question. Have honest conversation about what you each want and whether the relationship can work given those wants.
