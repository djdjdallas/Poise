Ethical non-monogamy isn't for everyone, and it isn't right for everyone right now. Before jumping in, honest self-assessment can save you—and others—significant pain.

Here's a comprehensive readiness checklist.

## Why Readiness Matters

### ENM Isn't a Fix

People sometimes try ENM to:
- Fix a struggling relationship
- Satisfy one partner while the other isn't enthusiastic
- Find excitement that's missing
- Avoid dealing with underlying issues

These motivations often lead to harm. ENM works best when relationships are already strong.

### The Stakes Are Real

Unready ENM can result in:
- Hurt partners (existing and new)
- Damaged or ended relationships
- Emotional trauma
- Lasting trust issues

Better to wait until you're ready than to rush and cause harm.

## Scoring Your Checklist

### Count Your Checks

**Mostly yes (35-45 checks):**
You're likely ready to begin exploring ENM thoughtfully. Continue learning and start slowly.

**Mixed (20-34 checks):**
You have some work to do before ENM is advisable. Focus on unchecked areas. No rush.

**Mostly no (under 20 checks):**
You're probably not ready for ENM right now. This isn't failure—it's self-awareness. Work on fundamentals first.

### Critical Items

Some items matter more than others. If these are unchecked, stop:
- Partner doesn't know and consent (if applicable)
- Using ENM to fix relationship problems
- Can't manage jealousy at all
- Can't communicate honestly
- One partner coerced into agreeing

## If You're Not Ready Yet

### This Isn't Failure

Recognizing you're not ready is wisdom, not weakness:
- Better to know now than after causing harm
- Readiness can develop over time
- Self-awareness is itself a positive sign

### What to Work On

**If communication is weak:**
- Practice difficult conversations in current relationship
- Read about communication skills
- Consider couples counseling
- Work on individual therapy

**If jealousy is overwhelming:**
- Explore the roots of jealousy
- Build security through therapy or self-work
- Practice with smaller exposures
- Develop emotional regulation skills

**If relationship foundation is shaky:**
- Address existing issues first
- Build trust and communication
- Get professional help if needed
- Don't add complexity to instability

**If you haven't done the learning:**
- Read foundational books (*The Ethical Slut*, *Polysecure*, etc.)
- Listen to podcasts and read articles
- Join communities to learn from others
- Take your time—there's no rush

### About Commitment

> "What are we committing to with each other?"

> "What would make us reconsider this?"

> "How often will we check in about how this is going?"

> "What does success look like for us?"
