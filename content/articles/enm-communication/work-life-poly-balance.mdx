Work demands your time. Relationships demand your time. Self-care demands your time. In polyamory, you're balancing all of this plus multiple partnerships. It's genuinely challenging—and requires intentional strategies.

Here's how to find sustainable work-life-poly balance.

## The Unique Challenge

### More Relationships, More Needs

**Poly adds:**
- Multiple partners' needs
- Multiple calendars to coordinate
- Multiple emotional investments
- Multiple relationship maintenance tasks

### Same 24 Hours

**Reality:**
- You still have the same time as everyone
- Work still requires what it requires
- Self-care still matters
- Something has to give if you overschedule

### No Perfect Balance

**Accept:**
- Balance shifts constantly
- Some periods favor different areas
- You can't be 100% everywhere
- Good enough is the goal

## Time Assessment

### Audit Your Time

**Track for a week:**
- Work hours (including commute, prep)
- Sleep and basic self-care
- Partner time (each relationship)
- Solo time
- Friends and family
- Hobbies and interests
- Administrative life tasks

### Find the Gaps

**Where is time going?**
- Are you overscheduled overall?
- Is any area getting squeezed?
- Where's the slack?
- What's unsustainable?

### Reality Check

**Be honest:**
- How many partners can you actually sustain?
- How much does work actually require?
- What's the minimum self-care you need?
- What's negotiable vs. not?

## FAQ

**How do I tell partners I need less time?**
Be honest about your constraints, frame it as overall capacity not their value, and work together on what's possible.

**Is it fair to date multiple people if I'm this busy?**
Only if you can give each relationship what it needs. If you can't, fewer deeper relationships may be healthier.

**What if work really does require all my time?**
Then that's reality for now. Communicate clearly, maintain what you can, and know it may limit your poly options.

**How do I avoid burning out?**
Protect self-care, say no to new things, communicate limits, and periodically assess if your configuration is sustainable.
