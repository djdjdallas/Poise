Within polyamory, one of the biggest structural questions is: should some relationships take priority over others? This is the hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical debate.

Both approaches have passionate advocates and real drawbacks. Understanding them helps you figure out what structure might work for your relationships.

## What Is Hierarchical Polyamory?

**Hierarchical polyamory** structures relationships in tiers, with some partnerships given priority over others.

### Common Hierarchy

**Primary partner(s):**
- Highest priority
- Major life decisions made together
- Often live together, share finances
- Get most time, energy, and commitment
- Usually have veto power (in some structures)

**Secondary partner(s):**
- Important but not primary
- Less time and involvement
- Don't share major life logistics
- May have relationship limits imposed

**Tertiary/casual connections:**
- Occasional or less involved
- May have strict boundaries
- Limited time investment

### How It Works in Practice

Example: Alex and Jordan are married and primary partners. Alex also dates Sam (secondary). Major decisions—moving, finances, scheduling—prioritize Alex and Jordan's needs. Sam understands this and accepts the structure.

---

## What Is Non-Hierarchical Polyamory?

**Non-hierarchical polyamory** avoids ranking relationships. Each connection is valued for what it is, not placed in a tier.

### Core Principles

- No relationship is inherently more important
- Each partnership is evaluated on its own merits
- "Primary" and "secondary" labels aren't used
- Decisions aren't automatically made to favor one relationship
- All partners have agency and voice

### What It Doesn't Mean

Non-hierarchical doesn't mean:
- All relationships get identical time
- New partners immediately get equal priority
- You can't live with one partner
- Every relationship must be intense

It means: rankings aren't predetermined. Relationships get what they need based on their own reality, not a hierarchy.

### How It Works in Practice

Example: Alex lives with Jordan (for practical reasons—they've been together longer and share a lease). Alex also dates Sam. When conflicts arise, they're navigated based on the specific situation, not by automatically prioritizing the live-in partnership.

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Hierarchical | Non-Hierarchical |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Priority** | Pre-determined by tier | Situation-dependent |
| **Labels** | Primary/secondary/etc. | Each relationship is itself |
| **Veto power** | Often exists | Typically doesn't |
| **Time allocation** | Primary gets most | Based on relationship needs |
| **Life decisions** | Primary partnership centered | All relevant partners consulted |
| **Commitment ceiling** | Secondaries may have limits | No predetermined limits |

## Arguments for Hierarchical Polyamory

### Security for Primary Partners

Hierarchy provides:
- Clear understanding of priority
- Protection of established relationship
- Security during new relationship energy
- Framework for managing time

### Practical Reality

Some argue hierarchy reflects reality:
- You can only live with so many people
- Legal marriage offers benefits
- Long-term partnerships have history
- Time is limited

### Transitioning from Monogamy

For couples opening up:
- Provides structure and safety
- Eases into complexity gradually
- Protects the original bond
- Clear boundaries reduce anxiety

---

## Arguments Against Hierarchical Polyamory

### Impact on Secondary Partners

Secondary status can mean:
- Feeling less valued or disposable
- Relationship ceiling imposed externally
- Being subject to veto without input
- Emotional labor without full partnership

### Artificially Limiting Connections

Hierarchy can prevent:
- Relationships from growing naturally
- New love from developing fully
- Partners from meeting their needs
- Organic relationship evolution

### Power Imbalance

Inherent issues:
- Primaries control secondaries' experiences
- Rules protect couple over individuals
- New partners have less voice
- Can perpetuate "couple privilege"

---

## "Descriptive" vs. "Prescriptive" Hierarchy

An important distinction:

### Prescriptive Hierarchy

Rules set in advance:
- "My spouse will always come first"
- "No secondary can ever live with us"
- "I have veto power over your other relationships"
- Limits exist regardless of how relationships develop

### Descriptive Hierarchy

Acknowledging current reality:
- "My spouse and I have 10 years of history together"
- "Currently, most of my time goes to my nesting partner"
- "As relationships develop, priorities may shift"
- Open to relationships growing without predetermined ceilings

Many non-hierarchical poly people are fine with descriptive hierarchy—acknowledging that established relationships have more history and current investment—while rejecting prescriptive rules that limit what new relationships can become.

## Common Structures

### Hierarchical Examples

**Kitchen Table Poly with Hierarchy:**
Everyone knows each other, socializes together, but there's a clear primary couple who make major decisions.

**Parallel Poly with Hierarchy:**
Relationships stay separate, primary partnership is protected, secondaries have limited involvement in primary's life.

### Non-Hierarchical Examples

**Kitchen Table Poly:**
Everyone interacts as a network, decisions involve relevant parties, no predetermined rankings.

**Solo Poly:**
No primary partner at all; each relationship stands alone. See our [solo poly guide](/enm-communication/solo-poly-explained).

**Relationship Anarchy:**
Rejects all labels and hierarchies; each relationship is defined by those in it. See our [relationship anarchy guide](/enm-communication/relationship-anarchy-explained).

## Which Is Right for You?

### Consider Hierarchical If:

- You're opening an existing committed relationship
- Security and structure feel important
- You and your partner want clear boundaries
- You're new to polyamory and want guardrails
- You're comfortable with limitations on new relationships

### Consider Non-Hierarchical If:

- You want relationships to grow organically
- "Secondary" status feels wrong to you
- You don't want to impose limits on love
- You're dating as an individual (even if partnered)
- Autonomy for all partners matters deeply

### Questions to Ask

- How would I feel being someone's secondary?
- Do I want predetermined limits on my relationships?
- Is it fair to ask partners to accept a ceiling?
- What happens if I develop feelings that exceed my "spot"?
- Can I balance partners' needs without ranking them?

## Navigating Hierarchy in Dating

### If You're Hierarchical

Be clear with potential partners:
- What being secondary means practically
- What limits exist (veto, time, involvement)
- What can and can't grow
- Why you've chosen this structure

### If You're Non-Hierarchical

Communicate:
- How you make decisions
- What equity looks like to you
- How you balance multiple partners
- What you can realistically offer

### Dating Someone with Different Structure

If you're non-hierarchical dating someone hierarchical:
- Understand their primary comes first
- Know your ceiling going in
- Decide if that works for you
- Don't expect the structure to change

---

## The Evolving Conversation

Polyamory communities continue debating hierarchy:
- Some see it as necessary and honest
- Others see it as harmful to secondaries
- Many land somewhere in between
- Your structure can evolve over time

There's no universally "right" answer—just what works for the people involved.
