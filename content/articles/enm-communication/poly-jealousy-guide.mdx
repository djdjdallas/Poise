"Polyamorous people don't get jealous" is one of the biggest myths about non-monogamy. The truth: most poly people experience jealousy. The difference is how they handle it.

This guide offers practical strategies for understanding and working through jealousy when you or your partners have multiple relationships.

## Jealousy Is Normal

### First, Stop Shaming Yourself

Feeling jealous doesn't mean:
- You're "bad at poly"
- You're not evolved enough
- You should be monogamous
- Your relationship is failing

Jealousy is a human emotion. It's information, not a verdict.

### What Jealousy Often Signals

Jealousy usually points to:
- Unmet needs
- Insecurity or fear
- Boundary violations
- Communication gaps
- Past wounds being triggered

The goal isn't to eliminate jealousy—it's to understand what it's telling you.

## Understanding Your Jealousy

### The HALT Check

Before processing jealousy, check if you're:
- **H**ungry
- **A**ngry (about something else)
- **L**onely
- **T**ired

Physical states amplify emotional responses. Sometimes "jealousy" is actually exhaustion.

### Dig Beneath the Surface

Jealousy is often a surface emotion covering deeper ones:

| Surface feeling | What might be underneath |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| "I'm jealous they're on a date" | Fear of being replaced |
| "I hate their new partner" | Insecurity about my worth |
| "I can't stand hearing about them" | Grief for how things used to be |
| "I want them to stop seeing them" | Need for more time/attention |

### Common Jealousy Triggers

- Partner spending time with someone new
- NRE (new relationship energy) in a partner's new relationship
- Partner doing something with someone else they don't do with you
- Feeling less attractive/interesting than a metamour
- Perceiving unequal treatment
- Changes in your relationship routine

---

## Processing Jealousy

### 1. Feel It First

Don't immediately try to fix or rationalize:
- Let yourself feel the emotion
- Don't act on it impulsively
- Give it space before responding

### 2. Identify the Specific Trigger

Get precise:
- Not "I'm jealous" but "I'm jealous because..."
- What specific event or thought triggered this?
- What story am I telling myself?

### 3. Separate Facts from Stories

**Fact:** My partner is excited about their new date.
**Story:** They're more excited about this person than they've ever been about me.

Challenge your stories with evidence.

### 4. Identify the Need

What do you actually need right now?
- Reassurance?
- Quality time?
- Information?
- A boundary respected?
- To be heard?

### 5. Make a Request

Turn your need into a specific, actionable request:
- "Can we have a date night this week, just us?"
- "I need you to tell me I'm important to you"
- "Can we talk about how much detail you share about dates?"

## Communicating About Jealousy

### How to Bring It Up

**Avoid:** "Your relationship with them makes me jealous" (blame)

**Try:** "I'm experiencing jealousy and I want to talk about what I might need" (ownership)

### What to Say

Framework: Observation + Feeling + Need + Request

> "When you came home from your date last night and immediately texted them [observation], I felt insecure and unimportant [feeling]. I need to feel prioritized when we're together [need]. Could you wait until after our time together to text them? [request]"

### What Your Partner Can Do

They can:
- Listen without getting defensive
- Validate your feelings
- Reassure you
- Make small adjustments that help
- Work on issues within their control

They can't:
- Fix your jealousy for you
- Never do anything that triggers jealousy
- Stop having other relationships
- Make you feel secure (that's internal work)

## Practical Strategies

### Before Partner's Dates

- Make plans for yourself
- Arrange time with friends
- Do something you enjoy solo
- Don't just wait at home

### During Partner's Dates

- Limit phone checking
- Stay busy with something engaging
- Have a support person you can text
- Practice grounding techniques if anxious

### After Partner's Dates

- Agree on reconnection rituals
- Decide how much detail you want
- Schedule quality time soon after
- Give yourself time to readjust

### Building Security Over Time

- Keep consistent relationship rituals
- Express appreciation regularly
- Follow through on commitments
- Check in about needs frequently

## When Jealousy Is Information

### Sometimes Jealousy Is Valid

Jealousy might be pointing to:
- Actual neglect of your relationship
- Broken agreements
- Dismissal of your feelings
- Real inequity in time/attention
- A partner not managing their NRE well

If your needs genuinely aren't being met, jealousy is appropriate feedback.

### When to Address the Relationship

If you consistently feel:
- Unimportant to your partner
- Like an afterthought
- That agreements aren't being kept
- That your concerns are dismissed

...the problem isn't your jealousy management. It's the relationship dynamic.

## Jealousy vs. Envy

**Jealousy:** Fear of losing something you have
**Envy:** Wanting something someone else has

In poly, you might feel:
- **Jealous** that your partner spends time with someone else (fear of loss)
- **Envious** of your metamour's qualities or their relationship with your partner

Both are normal. Processing them looks similar.

---

## The Other Side: Compersion

**Compersion** is feeling joy from your partner's happiness with others. It's sometimes called "the opposite of jealousy."

Compersion can coexist with jealousy:
- You can feel happy for your partner AND insecure
- Compersion often grows as security grows
- It's not a requirement for healthy poly

Don't pressure yourself to feel compersion. Focus on managing jealousy; compersion may follow.
