Few topics in polyamory are as debated as veto power—the ability for one partner to end another partner's relationship. It's a practice some consider necessary and others consider unethical.

Here's a balanced look at the debate.

## What Is Veto Power?

### The Definition

Veto power is an agreement that allows one partner to require another to end a relationship:
- "If my primary partner says so, I have to end things with you"
- Usually applies to existing partners vetoing new ones
- Can be explicit agreement or implicit assumption

### How It Typically Works

**The structure:**
- Primary/existing partner has veto right
- New/secondary partners are subject to it
- Veto can be exercised at any time
- Vetoed relationship must end

**The reasoning:**
- Protects existing relationship
- Provides safety net for primary
- Gives control over who affects your life

## The Arguments Against Veto Power

### 1. It Treats People as Disposable

**The concern:**
A new partner invests emotionally, builds connection, then can be discarded at someone else's decision—with no voice.

**The impact:**
- New partners have no security
- Their feelings don't matter in the equation
- They're essentially auditioning, not building

### 2. It Creates Unhealthy Power Dynamics

**The concern:**
The vetoing partner has unilateral power over someone else's relationship—that's not ethical relating.

**The structure:**
- One person has power
- The other has none
- The relationship can't be equal

### 3. It Doesn't Solve the Real Problem

**The argument:**
If a partner feels threatened by a new relationship, the veto addresses the symptom, not the cause:
- What's the underlying insecurity?
- Why isn't this addressed through communication?
- What happens when the next threat emerges?

### 4. It's Often Unnecessary

**The alternative:**
If someone's new relationship is genuinely harmful, their partner can:
- Express concerns
- Request changes
- Set boundaries
- End their own relationship if needed

They don't need formal veto power for any of this.

### 5. It Limits Growth

**The concern:**
Veto power protects against discomfort that might actually lead to growth:
- Jealousy that could be worked through
- Insecurity that could be healed
- Change that could be positive

## The Arguments For Veto Power

### 1. It Provides Security for Primaries

**The reasoning:**
Opening up is scary. Veto power gives the primary partner a safety valve:
- "We can try this, knowing I have an out"
- Reduces fear of being replaced
- Helps people take the leap

### 2. It Can Protect Against Genuine Threats

**The scenario:**
Sometimes a new partner is genuinely problematic:
- Red flags the dating partner doesn't see
- Behavior that threatens existing relationship
- Situations where outside perspective matters

### 3. It's a Stepping Stone

**The argument:**
For couples new to ENM, veto power might be a helpful training wheel:
- Used while building skills
- Removed as trust develops
- Better than not opening at all

### 4. It Reflects Real Hierarchy

**The logic:**
If a primary relationship actually takes priority, veto power makes that explicit:
- Honest about the hierarchy
- Clear expectations for new partners
- No hidden power dynamics

### 5. It's Consent-Based

**The defense:**
If everyone agrees to it—including new partners who enter knowing the rules—it's consensual:
- New partners can decline
- The structure is transparent
- Everyone makes informed choices

---

## The Ethical Problems

### Even When Consensual

Some argue that consent doesn't make it ethical:
- Power imbalances affect ability to truly consent
- New partners may agree hoping it never gets used
- Desperation for connection can compromise consent

### The Practiced Reality

In practice, veto power often:
- Gets used when a primary feels threatened, not when there's genuine danger
- Hurts the new partner significantly
- Doesn't address underlying issues
- Creates resentment in the middle partner

### Who Has Power?

- Primary: Has veto
- New partner: Has no veto
- Middle partner: Loses either way

## Alternatives to Veto Power

### 1. Influence, Not Control

**The approach:**
Partners can express concerns and have significant influence without having absolute control:

> "I have serious concerns about your relationship with [person]. Here's why. I'm asking you to hear me and consider this, but ultimately it's your decision."

### 2. Specific Boundaries Instead

**The approach:**
Rather than "I can end it," specific protective boundaries:

> "I need you to not bring new partners into our home yet."
> "I need two date nights a week to stay ours regardless."
> "I need you to not share certain information with them."

### 3. Pause Power

**The approach:**
Rather than ending, the ability to slow things down:

> "I'm struggling. Can you pause escalation with [person] while we work through this?"

### 4. Mutual Agreements with Exit Clauses

**The approach:**
Everyone agrees to conditions, and if conditions aren't met, there are consequences:

> "We've agreed that if either of us feels the relationship is threatening our partnership, we'll prioritize working on us. If that requires reducing outside relationships, we'll discuss that together."

### 5. Trust and Communication

**The approach:**
Instead of formal power, rely on:
- Trusting your partner's judgment
- Communicating concerns openly
- Working through difficult feelings
- Believing they care about your relationship

## If You Have Veto Power

### Use It Carefully

If your agreement includes veto:
- Consider it the nuclear option
- Address concerns through communication first
- Use it only when genuinely necessary
- Understand the impact on everyone

### Questions to Ask Before Using It

- Have I communicated my concerns clearly?
- Have we tried to address this other ways?
- Am I reacting from jealousy or genuine concern?
- What will this do to my partner's other relationship?
- What will this do to my relationship with my partner?

### The Relationship You're Actually Ending

When you veto:
- You end someone else's relationship
- You potentially damage your own (through resentment)
- You don't necessarily fix the underlying issue

---

## If You're Subject to Veto Power

### What to Know

Before entering a relationship where someone has veto:
- You have less security
- Your investment can be ended by someone else
- You're not building on equal footing

### Questions to Ask

- Under what circumstances would they use veto?
- Has it been used before?
- How do I feel about this dynamic?
- Is this worth the risk?

### It's Okay to Decline

You can decide this structure doesn't work for you:

> "I understand you have a veto agreement with your partner. I'm not comfortable being in a relationship with that structure. I wish you well."

## Finding Your Answer

### No Universal Right Answer

Different people land differently on this:
- Some couples use it and it works
- Others find it harmful
- Many evolve away from it
- Some never consider it

### Questions for Your Relationship

- What protection do we actually need?
- Can we achieve that protection without veto?
- What do we lose by having veto power?
- What do we lose by not having it?

### The Evolution

Many couples:
1. Start with veto power for security
2. Never use it
3. Realize they don't need it
4. Remove it as trust builds

That's a valid journey.
