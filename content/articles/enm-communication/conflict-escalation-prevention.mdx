## How Conflicts Escalate

### The Escalation Pattern

**Typical progression:**
1. Small issue raised
2. Defensive response
3. Criticism or complaint
4. Counter-criticism
5. Raised voices/emotions
6. Things said you can't take back
7. Full-blown fight

### ENM Escalation Triggers

**Poly-specific:**
- Jealousy triggering defensiveness
- Comparison to other partners
- Time/attention complaints
- Bringing up metamours
- NRE-related tensions

### Recognizing Early Warning Signs

**Watch for:**
- Defensive posture (physical or verbal)
- Volume increasing
- Speaking faster
- Bringing up other issues
- Absolutist language ("always," "never")

---

## Prevention Strategies

### Address Issues Early

**Before escalation:**
- Raise concerns when small
- Don't let things fester
- Regular check-ins help
- Prevention > de-escalation

### Choose Good Timing

**Don't start conversations:**
- When tired or hungry
- Right before/after time with other partner
- During other stress
- Without enough time to talk properly

### Set the Right Frame

**Start conversations by:**
- Expressing care for the relationship
- Stating desire to understand
- Asking to discuss, not demanding
- Indicating you want resolution

## Communication Techniques

### "I" Statements

**Instead of:**
- "You always cancel on me"

**Try:**
- "I feel unimportant when plans change last minute"

**This:**
- Shares your experience
- Reduces defensiveness
- Opens dialogue
- Focuses on impact

### Soft Starts

**Begin gently:**
- "I've been feeling..." not "You make me feel..."
- "Can we talk about..." not "We need to talk"
- "I'd like to understand..." not "Why do you always..."

### Active Listening

**Show you're hearing:**
- Reflect back what they said
- Ask clarifying questions
- Don't interrupt to defend
- Validate before responding

### Taking Responsibility

**Own your part:**
- "You're right that I..."
- "I can see how that would feel..."
- "I should have..."
- This reduces their need to attack

## In-the-Moment De-escalation

### Recognize When Escalating

**Notice:**
- Your own body (tension, heart rate)
- Your voice (volume, speed)
- Your words (accusations, absolutes)
- Their responses (defensive, loud)

### Call a Pause

**Say:**
- "I think we're both getting activated"
- "Can we take a break and come back to this?"
- "I want to continue, but I need a minute"
- "Let's pause and breathe"

### Agree on Pause Protocol

**Pre-agree:**
- Either can call a break
- How long (20 min, hour, etc.)
- Commitment to return
- What to do during break

### During the Pause

**Use the time to:**
- Calm your nervous system
- Reflect on your part
- Consider their perspective
- Prepare to re-engage constructively

## FAQ

**How do I stop myself from escalating when I'm upset?**
Recognize your own signs (body, voice, thoughts). Build in pause protocols. Practice regulation skills. Start with smaller conflicts.

**What if my partner escalates and won't stop?**
You can still remove yourself. "I'm not able to have this conversation productively right now. I love you and want to talk when we're both calmer."

**Is it avoiding conflict to de-escalate?**
No—it's making conflict productive rather than destructive. You're not avoiding the issue, just how you address it.

**What if we always escalate despite trying?**
Consider therapy to learn new patterns. Some couples need professional help to break escalation cycles.
