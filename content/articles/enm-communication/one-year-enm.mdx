## FAQ

**Is it supposed to be this hard?**
For most people, yes. Year one is intense. It does generally get easier as skills develop and relationships stabilize.

**How do I know if I should keep going or stop?**
If you're still growing and want this life, keep going. If you're consistently miserable despite genuine effort, ENM may not be for you. Give it time before deciding.

**What if my partner and I are having very different experiences?**
This is common. One often dates more, feels better, or adapts faster. Support each other through the asymmetry.

**When does it get easier?**
Different for everyone. Many report things settling somewhere between months 6-18. Some aspects remain challenging while others become natural.
