Your photos are the first thing people see on Feeld. Before they read your bio, check your Desires, or consider your compatibility—they're looking at your pictures and making a split-second decision.

Feeld users tend to be more discerning than mainstream dating app users. They're looking for specific compatibility signals, not just surface attraction. This guide shows you what actually works for Feeld photos and what's silently killing your match rate.

## Why Feeld Photos Are Different

Feeld isn't Tinder. The audience is different, and what they're looking for in photos is different too.

**Feeld users typically want to see:**
- Authenticity over polish
- Personality and context
- Who you actually are right now
- Signals about your lifestyle and interests

**What works less well on Feeld:**
- Over-filtered Instagram aesthetics
- Pure thirst traps without substance
- Generic "I could be anyone" photos
- Obvious performance

This doesn't mean you shouldn't look good—you should. But the goal is "attractive AND interesting" rather than just "hot."

## The Essential Photo Lineup

Aim for 5-6 photos that cover these bases:

### 1. Clear Face Shot (Required)

Your first photo should show your face clearly:
- Good lighting (natural light is best)
- Looking at camera or near it
- Genuine expression (not forced smile)
- Recent—looks like current you

**Don't:** Use a photo where you're far away, in shadows, or wearing sunglasses.

### 2. Full Body Shot (Required)

At least one photo showing your whole body:
- Standing naturally
- Wearing clothes you'd actually wear
- In a real setting (not bathroom mirror)
- Accurate representation of your current self

**Why this matters:** People want to know what you look like. Hiding it only delays disappointment for everyone.

### 3. Activity/Context Shot

Show yourself doing something:
- A hobby you actually have
- A place you actually go
- Something that represents your life

This gives people something to ask about and shows you have a life beyond dating apps.

### 4. Social Shot (Optional but Helpful)

A photo with friends shows you're:
- Socially connected
- Comfortable in groups
- Someone others enjoy being around

**Make sure:** You're clearly identifiable (ideally mentioned in caption or obviously the focus).

### 5. Personality Shot

Something that shows who you are:
- Your sense of humor
- A unique interest
- Your style or vibe
- What makes you different

This is where you stand out from the generic profiles.

### 6. Couple Photo (If Applicable)

If you're coupled and on Feeld together:
- At least one photo showing you both
- Make clear which person's profile this is
- Show your dynamic together

See our [Feeld for couples guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-for-couples) for more couple-specific advice.

## Photo Quality Basics

### Lighting
- Natural daylight is almost always best
- Avoid harsh overhead lights
- Face toward the light source
- Golden hour (sunrise/sunset) is flattering

### Resolution
- Clear, sharp images (no blur)
- Avoid heavy cropping from distant photos
- Phone cameras are fine if used well

### Framing
- You should be the clear subject
- Leave some context/background
- Don't crop too tight on your face

### Editing
- Minimal is better than heavy
- Adjust brightness/contrast if needed
- Don't filter yourself into someone else

## What to Avoid

### The "Mystery" Approach
Photos where people can't see what you look like don't create intrigue—they create suspicion that you're hiding something.

**Avoid:**
- Sunglasses in every photo
- Distance shots where you're tiny
- Heavy shadows obscuring your face
- Masks, hats, or hands covering features

### The Generic Gallery
A lineup of unremarkable photos says nothing about who you are:

**Skip:**
- The fish you caught (unless fishing is genuinely important to you)
- The Machu Picchu tourist shot (everyone has one)
- The "me at a wedding" formal photo
- Mirror selfies with phone visible

### The Thirst-Only Approach
Feeld is sex-positive, but that doesn't mean your profile should be entirely shirtless gym selfies or cleavage shots.

**The problem:** It signals "I'm only here for physical validation" rather than "I'm an interesting person who also has a body."

**Better approach:** One photo that shows physicality + several that show personality.

### Outdated Photos
Using photos from 5+ years ago sets up disappointment. You'll match with people attracted to who you were, not who you are.

**Rule:** If you look noticeably different now, the photo is too old.

## Photos for Specific Situations

### For ENM/Poly Profiles
Your photos should signal openness and emotional intelligence:
- Warm, approachable expressions
- Photos that show you have a full life
- Avoid anything that reads as "looking to cheat"

### For Kink-Interested Profiles
You don't need to show everything in photos:
- Subtle signals work (accessories, aesthetics)
- Save explicit content for after matching
- Show personality beyond kink

### For Couples
Both partners need quality representation:
- Individual clear photos of each
- At least one together
- Show your dynamic, not just your bodies
- Make sure both people look good (not just one)

### For Single Men
Competition is real. Stand out by:
- Showing emotional range (not just stoic poses)
- Demonstrating interests beyond dating
- Including social proof (photos with friends)
- Avoiding anything that reads as aggressive or desperate

## Getting Better Photos

### The Quick Fix
Ask a friend to take 10 photos of you in good lighting. Pick the best 2-3. This alone beats most phone selfies.

### The Weekend Project
1. Find 2-3 locations with good natural light
2. Wear something you feel confident in
3. Have a friend take 50+ photos
4. Pick the best 5-6 across locations
5. Lightly edit for brightness if needed

### The Professional Option
If photos are your weakness, consider:
- A casual photoshoot with a photographer friend
- Professional headshots (just don't use the corporate formal ones)
- Dating profile photo services (they exist)

The investment in good photos pays off in matches.

## Photo Order Strategy

The order of your photos matters:

**Photo 1:** Best clear face shot—this is your hook
**Photo 2-3:** Supporting photos showing body, activities
**Photo 4-5:** Personality and context
**Photo 6:** Couple shot if applicable, or another strong option

Your first photo gets 90% of the attention. Make it count.

## Testing Your Photos

### Ask for Honest Feedback
Show your photos to:
- Friends who use dating apps
- People in your target demographic (if possible)
- Anyone who'll be brutally honest

Ask: "What do these photos say about me?" and "Would you swipe right?"

### A/B Test on the App
If you're not getting matches:
1. Change your first photo
2. Wait a week
3. Compare results
4. Repeat until you find what works

Small changes can make big differences.

## Photo FAQs

### How many photos should I have?
5-6 is ideal. Fewer feels incomplete; more than 8 can feel excessive.

### Should I include professional photos?
Only if they don't look too corporate or staged. Natural-looking professional photos work; stiff headshots don't.

### What about photos with exes?
No. Even cropped ones are obvious and weird.

### Can I use the same photos as other apps?
You can, but Feeld's audience might respond differently. Consider what signals work for this specific community.

### Should I show off my body?
One photo that tastefully shows your physique is fine. A gallery of flexing shots is not.
