Rejection is part of dating apps. On Feeld, where people are often seeking specific connections, incompatibility is common and normal. How you handle rejection—both receiving and giving it—shapes your experience.

---

## Receiving Rejection

### It's Information, Not Indictment

**Remember:**
- Rejection means incompatibility
- It's not a judgment of your worth
- They don't have enough information to reject "you"
- It's specific to this match

### Common Forms on Feeld

**Rejection looks like:**
- No match (they swiped left)
- Match but no message
- Conversation that stops
- Direct "not interested"
- Being unmatched

### Normalizing It

**The reality:**
- Most matches don't lead anywhere
- Even attractive people face rejection
- It's a numbers game
- Each rejection brings you closer to a yes

---

## When You Don't Get a Match

### They Swiped Left

**This means:**
- Profile didn't appeal to them
- Or you're not what they're seeking
- Or they weren't active
- Or many other things

**Not what it means:**
- You're unattractive
- You're unlovable
- Something's wrong with you

### No Response to Your Like

**If they don't match back:**
- They're not interested (valid)
- They didn't see it (possible)
- They're overwhelmed with matches (common)
- Move on regardless

---

## When Conversation Stops

### The Fade

**When they stop responding:**
- This is common on all apps
- It's a form of passive rejection
- They may have gotten busy
- Or lost interest

**Your response:**
- One follow-up after a while is okay
- If still no response, let go
- Don't keep messaging
- Don't take it personally

### Being Left on Read

**When they see but don't respond:**
- Same as the fade, really
- They're not interested enough
- Accept the non-answer as an answer
- Move on

---

## When They Say No Directly

### Actually Appreciate This

**Direct rejection is:**
- Clearer than ghosting
- Respectful of your time
- Takes courage
- Worth acknowledging

### Good Responses

**Say something like:**
- "Thanks for letting me know—best of luck!"
- "No worries, I appreciate the honesty"
- "Got it, take care"
- Or nothing at all is fine

### Bad Responses

**Don't:**
- Ask why
- Try to change their mind
- Insult them
- Keep messaging
- React with anger

---

## Being Unmatched

### What Happens

**When someone unmatches:**
- Conversation disappears
- You can't contact them
- It's final

### Why It Happens

**Possibilities:**
- They're not interested
- They're cleaning up matches
- They found someone
- They left the app
- Many reasons that aren't about you

### How to Handle It

**Approach:**
- Notice, shrug, move on
- Don't dwell
- Don't search for them elsewhere
- It's just part of apps

---

## Rejection After Meeting

### This Hurts More

**Because:**
- More investment
- Felt more personal
- Had actual interaction
- Can feel like being judged as a person

### Reframe

**Remember:**
- One date is still minimal information
- Chemistry in person is unpredictable
- They're rejecting the match, not you as a human
- This happens to everyone

### Moving Forward

**After rejection post-date:**
- Allow yourself to feel disappointed
- Don't over-analyze what you did "wrong"
- Get back on the app when ready
- One date doesn't define your dating life

---

## Giving Rejection

### Why It Matters

**Good rejection:**
- Respects their time
- Reduces uncertainty
- Shows basic courtesy
- Is something you'd want received

### When to Say Something

**Consider direct rejection when:**
- You've had real conversation
- You've made plans
- You've met in person
- They've invested time

### How to Say It

**Good approaches:**
- "I'm not feeling a connection, but I wish you the best"
- "I've enjoyed talking, but don't think we're a match"
- "I don't want to lead you on—I'm not interested romantically"
- Brief, kind, clear

### What to Avoid

**Don't:**
- List everything wrong with them
- Give unsolicited feedback
- Be cruel
- Negotiate or explain excessively

---

## The Ghosting Question

### When It's Acceptable

**Early stages:**
- Before matching (swiping left)
- Very early conversation (one or two messages)
- When you feel unsafe
- When they've been inappropriate

### When It's Not Ideal

**After investment:**
- Extended conversations
- Plans made
- Meeting in person
- Clear mutual interest established

### A Middle Ground

**If full message feels like too much:**
- A simple "not feeling it, best of luck" is enough
- You don't owe extensive explanation
- Something is often better than nothing
- Do what you'd want received

---

## Emotional Regulation

### When Rejection Stings

**Allow yourself:**
- To feel disappointed
- To be frustrated
- To need a break
- To talk to friends

### When You Want to React Badly

**Before sending that message:**
- Put down the phone
- Walk away for an hour
- Ask if you'd be proud of this later
- Remember it's about you, not them

### Building Resilience

**Over time:**
- Rejection gets easier
- You develop thicker skin
- You take it less personally
- It becomes routine

---

## Patterns to Watch

### If You're Always Getting Rejected

**Consider:**
- Is your profile representing you well?
- Are you targeting compatible people?
- Is something in your approach off?
- Are expectations realistic?

### If You're Always Rejecting

**Ask yourself:**
- Are your standards realistic?
- Are you finding excuses to reject?
- Is something else going on?
- Are you actually ready to connect?

## FAQ

**Should I ask why they rejected me?**
Usually no. It puts them in an uncomfortable position and rarely provides useful information. Reflect on your own.

**How do I stop taking rejection personally?**
Remember it's about compatibility, not worth. Build identity outside of dating. Recognize it happens to literally everyone.

**Is it rude to unmatch without saying anything?**
For early-stage matches with little conversation, it's normal. After more investment, a brief message is kinder.

**What if I see someone who rejected me in real life?**
Pretend you didn't recognize them unless they approach you. Don't make it awkward.
