## See Who Likes You

### What It Does

This feature shows you everyone who has liked your profile before you match with them. Instead of swiping and hoping for matches, you see who's already interested.

### How to Use It

- Access your "Likes Received" section
- Browse through profiles that liked you
- Choose to like them back (instant match) or pass
- Prioritize people already interested

### Why It Matters

**This is Majestic's most valuable feature because:**
- Eliminates guessing about mutual interest
- Guarantees matches when you like back
- Saves time swiping randomly
- Shows your demand immediately

### Best Practices

- Check regularly for new likes
- Don't just auto-match everyone—still be selective
- Use it to understand what profiles attract you
- Quality still matters over quantity

---

## Unlimited Likes

### What It Does

Removes the daily limit on how many profiles you can like. Swipe right as many times as you want without hitting a wall.

### How to Use It

Simply... keep swiping. No more "out of likes" messages or waiting until tomorrow.

### Why It Matters

**Valuable for:**
- Heavy users who hit limits
- People in large dating pools
- Those swiping through many profiles
- Active, daily users

### Best Practices

- Just because you can like unlimited doesn't mean you should
- Stay selective even without limits
- Quality over quantity still applies
- Don't let unlimited = mindless

### Why It Matters

**Valuable for:**

- Use when privacy matters more than visibility
- Toggle on/off based on needs
- Understand the trade-off

## Read Receipts

### What It Does

Shows you when your messages have been read by the recipient. You'll see an indicator when they've opened your message.

- Understand response context better

### Why It Matters

**Provides:**
- Clarity about whether messages were received
- Information about engagement
- Context for non-responses
- Reduced wondering

### Best Practices

- Don't obsess over read receipts
- A read message without response might just mean they're busy
- Don't create anxiety with this feature
- Use information productively
