## What Are Private Photos

### How It Works

**The basics:**
- Photos only you can see initially
- You choose who gets access
- Recipients must request or be granted access
- You control who sees what

### What They're For

**Intended use:**
- Racier content not suitable for main profile
- More revealing photos for interested matches
- Building anticipation and intimacy
- Selective sharing

## What to Put in Private Photos

### Good Content

**Consider including:**
- More revealing (but still guideline-compliant) photos
- Tasteful sexy photos
- Body photos you want to share selectively
- Intimate glimpses (within reason)

### What Not to Include

**Avoid:**
- Anything violating Feeld's content policy
- Explicit content that could get you banned
- Photos you'd regret if they got out
- Anything you're not comfortable with

### Quality Still Matters

**Private photos should be:**
- Good quality (lighting, clarity)
- Flattering
- Representative
- Worth the "reveal"

## When to Share Private Photos

### Don't Share Immediately

**Problems with instant sharing:**
- Devalues the content
- Signals desperation
- Sets wrong expectations
- Misses opportunity for buildup

### Better Timing

**Share when:**
- Conversation has developed
- Mutual interest established
- Trust building
- Natural progression toward intimacy

### Read the Context

**Consider:**
- What kind of connection they're seeking
- How the conversation is going
- Whether they've requested
- What sharing communicates

## Who to Share With

### Selective Sharing

**Share with:**
- Matches you're genuinely interested in
- People who seem interested in you
- Connections with clear mutual attraction
- Those who've shown respect

### Who Not to Share With

**Be cautious with:**
- Brand new matches (no rapport yet)
- Anyone making you uncomfortable
- People who only seem interested in photos
- Matches you're not actually pursuing

### Trust Your Instincts

**If something feels off:**
- You don't have to share
- No explanation required
- Protect yourself
- Better to be cautious

### If Boundaries Are Violated

## Common Mistakes

### Putting Best Content as Private

**Problem:**
- Main profile looks weak
- Holding back too much
- Matches may never see your best

**Better approach:**
- Strong public profile first
- Private photos as bonus
- Don't hide your best self

### Only Revealing Photos

**Problem:**
- Looks like you only have body to offer
- Sets limiting expectations
- Objectifying yourself

**Better approach:**
- Mix of content types
- Private photos are addition, not substitution
- Show whole self

### Transactional Sharing

**Problem:**
- "I'll show you mine if you show me yours"
- Makes it feel like trade
- Can create pressure

**Better approach:**
- Share when you want to
- Don't require reciprocity
- Let it feel natural

## FAQ

**How many private photos should I have?**
2-5 is usually plenty. Quality over quantity. Enough for interest, not so many it's overwhelming.

**Should I have private photos at all?**
Optional. If you have content you want to share selectively, yes. If not, a strong public profile is fine.

**What if someone only wants to see my private photos?**
That's information about their priorities. If they're not interested in conversation beyond photos, they're probably not a good match.

**Can I change what's public vs. private?**
Yes, you can move photos between public and private as your comfort and strategy evolve.
