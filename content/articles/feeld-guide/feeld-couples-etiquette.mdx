## Valuing the Third Person

### They're Not a Fantasy Fulfillment

**Treat them as:**
- A full person with their own desires
- Someone with agency
- A person you want to get to know
- An equal participant

### What Do They Get?

**Consider:**
- What's in this for them?
- What are you offering?
- How will they be valued?
- Is this mutually beneficial?

### Their Preferences Matter

**Ask about:**
- What they're looking for
- What interests them about you
- What they want from the experience
- How they like to connect

## The First Meeting

### Both Should Be There

**Unless agreed otherwise:**
- If you date as a couple, meet as a couple
- Don't surprise them with only one person
- Don't surprise them with the other appearing later
- What's expected should be what happens

### Avoid Overwhelming

**In person:**
- Don't make them feel outnumbered
- Create comfortable dynamic
- Give them space in conversation
- Make sure they feel at ease

### Equal Attention

**Distribute focus:**
- Both partners engage with them
- Don't make them feel like they're entertaining
- Not a job interview
- Natural, comfortable interaction

## Intimacy Etiquette

### Clear Communication First

**Before anything physical:**
- What does everyone want?
- What are boundaries?
- What are expectations?
- Is everyone enthusiastically consenting?

### Check In During

**During intimate time:**
- Everyone still comfortable?
- Anyone need to adjust?
- Is this working for the third?
- Ongoing consent matters

### Both Partners Care About Third's Experience

**Make sure:**
- They're enjoying themselves
- Their pleasure matters
- They don't feel used
- It's mutual satisfaction

## Avoiding Unicorn Hunter Behavior

### What Unicorn Hunting Looks Like

**Problematic patterns:**
- Viewing thirds as accessories to couple fantasy
- Not caring about third's experience
- Couple comes as package, third is interchangeable
- Discarding after fantasy is fulfilled

### How to Be Different

**Good couples:**
- See thirds as individuals
- Care about their experience
- Build actual connection
- Treat them as full participant

### Checking Yourselves

**Ask:**
- Do we see this person as a person?
- Are we just seeking any third, or this person?
- What are we offering them?
- How would we feel in their position?

## Handling Differential Attraction

### When One Partner Is More Attracted

**This happens:**

- Honesty and kindness are key

### Communication Between Partners

**Discuss:**
- How do you both feel?
- Is it okay to proceed?
- What does this mean for the connection?
- How do you handle it together?

### Being Honest with Third

**If dynamic is unequal:**
- Be honest about where you both are
- Don't pretend equal interest
- Let them decide with full information
- Don't mislead to keep them around

## Couple Issues on Display

### Don't Use Thirds for Couple Problems

**Red flags:**

- Don't air dirty laundry

### If Issues Arise

**Handle privately:**
- Disagree privately, not on dates

### Follow Up Together

**Post-date:**
