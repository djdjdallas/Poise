You've got matches sitting in your Feeld inbox collecting dust. Some never messaged, some conversations died, some you're just not interested in anymore.

When should you unmatch—and when should you keep them around?

## Why Unmatching Matters

### Mental Clutter

**Dead matches:**
- Create visual noise
- Feel like unfinished business
- Take mental energy to scroll past
- Make your match list overwhelming

### Opportunity Cost

**Time spent on bad matches:**
- Could go to better connections
- Creates false sense of activity
- Doesn't move you toward goals
- Distraction from real prospects

### Clarity

**A clean match list:**
- Contains only people you'd actually meet
- Makes focusing easier
- Feels more manageable
- Reflects your real options

## Clear Reasons to Unmatch

### They're Disrespectful

**Unmatch immediately if:**
- Rude or hostile messages
- Boundary violations
- Harassment
- Anything that makes you uncomfortable

**No explanation needed.** Your safety and comfort come first.

### Obvious Incompatibility

**Unmatch when you realize:**
- Fundamental values clash
- Looking for different things
- Dealbreaker revealed
- No chance of working out

**Don't waste their time or yours.**

### They're Not Who They Said

**If you discover:**
- Misrepresentation (age, status, photos)
- Catfish signals
- Dishonesty about important things

**Exit without guilt.**

### You're Not Interested

**Simple but valid:**
- Changed your mind
- Not attracted anymore
- Can't see this going anywhere
- Would never actually meet them

**You don't owe them a continued match.**

## Gray Area Situations

### They Haven't Messaged

**Consider:**
- How long has it been?
- Did you message first?
- Might they message eventually?

**Guidelines:**
- You messaged, no response for 1+ weeks → probably unmatch
- Neither messaged, 2+ weeks → probably unmatch
- Fresh match, neither messaged → give it a few days

### Conversation Died

**Consider:**
- Was it a mutual fade?
- Could it be revived?
- Do you actually want to revive it?

**Guidelines:**
- If you'd message again to restart → keep
- If you have no intention of reaching out → unmatch
- If you already tried to restart and got nothing → unmatch

### Not Sure About Them

**Consider:**
- Are you genuinely undecided?
- Might meeting clarify?
- Or are you just avoiding unmatching?

**Guidelines:**
- If genuinely curious → keep for now
- If you're just being non-confrontational → unmatch
- If meeting would answer your question → suggest meeting

### Keeping Them "Just in Case"

**Consider:**
- Are you actually going to pursue this?
- Is this fair to them?
- Is this cluttering your experience?

**Usually:** If you're keeping them "just in case," you're probably not interested enough. Unmatch.

## When to Keep a Match

### Active, Good Conversation

**Obviously keep if:**
- Conversation is flowing
- You're interested
- There's momentum
- Planning to meet

### Temporarily Busy

**Keep if:**
- One of you mentioned being busy temporarily
- There's explicit pause with intention to reconnect
- Life circumstances are preventing progression
- You've agreed to pick back up later

### New Match

**Keep if:**
- Match just happened
- Give them time to see and respond
- Don't expect immediate response
- Few days minimum before assessing

### Worth Reviving

**Keep if:**
- You'd actually reach out to restart
- There's potential you see
- You're going to follow through
- Not just theoretical interest

## The Unmatch Process

### No Message Needed

**You don't have to:**
- Send a goodbye message
- Explain why you're unmatching
- Give them closure
- Feel guilty about it

**Unmatching is:** Normal, expected, not personal.

### When a Message Might Be Kind

**Consider messaging if:**
- You've had extended conversation
- You've met in person
- There's a good reason (met someone, not in right space)
- You want to leave door open for future

**Example:**
> "Hey, I've enjoyed our conversation, but I'm going to focus on some other connections right now. Wishing you all the best!"

### When Ghosting Is Actually Fine

**No message needed when:**
- Conversation never got going
- It's been dead for weeks
- They've already stopped responding
- You never met in person

### Blocking vs. Unmatching

**Unmatch:** They won't see you; they might reappear in your stack later
**Block:** More permanent; use for problematic people

## How to Decide

### The "Would I Actually Meet Them?" Test

**Ask yourself:**
- If they messaged right now wanting to meet, would I?
- Would I text them to revive this conversation?
- Do I have genuine interest or theoretical interest?

**If no to all:** Unmatch.

### The Clutter Test

**Ask yourself:**
- Does seeing them in my matches cause stress?
- Am I keeping them out of guilt?
- Would my match list be better without them?

**If yes:** Unmatch.

### The Energy Test

**Ask yourself:**
- Does thinking about this match drain me?
- Am I avoiding dealing with it?
- Would unmatching feel like relief?

**If yes:** Unmatch.

## Batch Cleaning

### Regular Inbox Cleanup

**Periodically:**
- Scroll through all matches
- Apply the tests above
- Unmatch the dead weight
- Start fresh

### When to Clean

**Good times:**
- Weekly or bi-weekly
- Before boosting or profile refresh
- When feeling overwhelmed
- When you've been inactive and returning

### How to Clean

**Quick process:**
1. Open each match
2. Ask: Would I actually pursue this?
3. No → unmatch
4. Yes → keep (and maybe message!)

## Emotional Considerations

### They Won't Know

**Remember:**
- Unmatching is silent
- They won't get a notification
- They might not notice
- If they do, they'll understand

### It's Not Personal

**Unmatching reflects:**
- Your current bandwidth
- Your current needs
- Compatibility assessment
- Normal dating app behavior

**It doesn't mean:**
- They're a bad person
- Something is wrong with them
- They should feel bad
- You're rejecting their worth

### Don't Keep Dead Matches Out of Guilt

**Guilt-matching:**
- Doesn't help them
- Clutters your experience
- Isn't honest
- Isn't kind (just avoidant)

## FAQ

**Will they know I unmatched?**
No notification. They'll just stop seeing you in their matches (and might not notice).

**Can we rematch later?**
Possibly, if you both reappear in each other's stacks and both swipe right again. Not guaranteed.

**Is unmatching rude?**
No. It's normal dating app behavior. It's only rude if you ghost someone you've been actively dating in person.

**Should I unmatch or just ignore?**
Unmatching is cleaner. Ignoring leaves clutter. Both achieve the same outcome; unmatching is more decisive.
