## The Feeld Landscape for Queer Women

### What You'll Find

**The user base includes:**
- Queer women seeking women
- Bi/pan women exploring
- Women in ENM relationships
- Couples (yes, many couples)
- Non-binary people
- Trans women

**The reality:**
- Smaller pool than mainstream apps
- Higher concentration of ENM/poly folks
- More sexually open profiles
- Couples seeking "thirds" are common
- Quality can be higher than quantity

### Setting Your Preferences

**Feeld allows:**
- Showing your profile to specific genders
- Setting who you want to see
- Multiple sexuality options
- Clear relationship status display

**For queer women:**
- Set to see women (and non-binary if interested)
- Decide on couples visibility (can hide them)
- Be explicit about what you're seeking
- Use bio to clarify further

## Common Challenges

### The Couple Question

**Reality check:**
- Many couples seek queer women
- "Unicorn hunting" is real
- Even with filters, couples appear
- Can feel objectifying

**How to handle:**
- Use filters to reduce couple visibility
- Clear bio statement if not interested
- Don't feel obligated to respond
- Some couples are genuinely great—your call

**If you're open to couples:**
- Look for equal engagement from both
- Watch for red flags
- Ensure both actually want this
- Set clear expectations

### Smaller Dating Pool

**Depending on location:**
- Major cities: reasonable selection
- Smaller areas: limited options
- May see same profiles repeatedly
- Can feel discouraging

**What helps:**
- Patience
- Expanding radius (if possible)
- Using multiple apps
- Quality over quantity mindset

### Men in Your Stack

**Despite settings:**
- Some men still appear
- Couples with men show up
- Can be frustrating
- Reporting helps

**What to do:**
- Report inappropriate appearances
- Swipe left and move on
- Adjust settings if needed
- Don't let it discourage you

## Profile Optimization for WLW

### Photos That Work

**Good choices:**
- Clear face shots
- Full body photos
- Photos showing your style/vibe
- Activities and interests
- Genuine expressions

**Consider:**
- Photos that signal queerness (if you want)
- Avoiding heavy filters
- Showing personality
- Mix of posed and candid

### Bio Strategy

**Be clear about:**
- What you're seeking
- Your relationship status
- Whether you're open to couples (or not)
- What you're NOT looking for

**Example bios:**

For WLW only:
> "Queer woman seeking connections with women and non-binary folks only. Not interested in couples or men. Let's talk about books, hiking, and your latest obsession."

Open to more:
> "Bi woman in an open relationship. Looking for genuine connections with women—dates, friendship, maybe more. My partner is not involved in my dating."

### Using Desires

**Select desires that:**
- Reflect your actual interests
- Help matching
- Signal what you're seeking
- Don't misrepresent you

## Navigating Conversations

### Common Openers You'll Receive

**From women:**
- Usually more thoughtful
- Reference your profile
- Can still be awkward
- Quality varies

**From couples:**
- Often generic
- "We think you're cute"
- May feel objectifying
- Some are genuine

### Opening Conversations

**Good approaches:**
- Reference something specific in their profile
- Ask about shared interests
- Show genuine curiosity
- Be yourself

**Example:**
> "Your photos from that hiking trip look amazing—where was that? I've been trying to find good trails near the city."

### Moving Forward

**Queer women dating can be:**
- Slower to progress (sometimes)
- More communicative
- Less aggressive
- Sometimes stuck in "talking" phase

**Keep momentum:**
- Suggest meeting when interest is clear
- Don't endless text
- Be direct about interest
- Take initiative
