## What Majestic Actually Unlocks

Here's a breakdown of premium features and their real-world value:

### See Who Liked You
You can view everyone who's already interested before you swipe. This is the single most valuable premium feature—you stop swiping blind and can prioritize people who want to match.

### Advanced Filters
Filter by specific desires, relationship structures, and more precise preferences. Essential in cities with large user bases where you'd otherwise scroll through hundreds of incompatible profiles.

### Incognito Mode
Browse invisibly until you like someone. Crucial for privacy-conscious users, public figures, or anyone concerned about being spotted by coworkers or friends.

### Activity Status
See when someone was last active. Helps you know if a profile is still being used or has been abandoned.

### More Pings
Additional pings (super-likes) to get attention from people you're especially interested in. See our [complete ping guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-ping-guide) for how to use them effectively.

### Unlimited Rewinds
Undo accidental left swipes. Less essential than other features but nice to have.

## Free vs Majestic: Which Do You Need?

### Free Works Well If You:
- Are in a smaller city with fewer users
- Use Feeld casually (a few times a week)
- Don't mind patient swiping without seeing likes
- Are testing the app to see if it's for you
- Have time but not money to spare

### Majestic Is Worth It If You:
- Use Feeld regularly (daily or near-daily)
- Live in a major city with lots of users
- Need privacy (Incognito mode)
- Are specific about what you're looking for
- Value time over money
- Are a couple dealing with high volume

## Feeld Pricing vs Other Dating Apps

How does Feeld compare to mainstream alternatives?

| App | Basic Premium Price | See Likes | Advanced Filters | Incognito |
|-----|---------------------|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Feeld Majestic | ~$15-30/mo | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Tinder Gold | ~$15-30/mo | Yes | Limited | Limited |
| Hinge Preferred | ~$35-50/mo | Yes | Yes | No |
| Bumble Premium | ~$30-40/mo | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| The League | ~$200-400/mo | Yes | Yes | No |

Feeld is competitively priced for what it offers. The real differentiator isn't price—it's that Feeld serves ENM, kink, and alternative relationship communities that mainstream apps don't cater to well.

## How to Save on Feeld Majestic

### Choose Longer Subscriptions
The per-month cost drops dramatically with longer commitments. If you know you'll use Feeld for several months, the 6 or 12-month plans offer the best value.

### Watch for Promotions
Feeld runs occasional sales, especially around holidays or when re-engaging lapsed users. If you're not in a rush, wait for a promotional email.

### Try a Free Trial First
Feeld sometimes offers 7-day Majestic trials. If you see one, take it—experience the features before committing any money.

### Start with 1 Month
If you're unsure, pay for one month at the higher price to test. It's better than committing to 6 months and realizing premium isn't helping.

### Cancel Before Renewal
If you subscribed for a trial period or promo, mark your calendar before auto-renewal kicks in at the full price.

## Is Feeld Premium Worth the Money?

**Short answer:** It depends on how you use the app.

**Worth it for:**
- Heavy users who check daily
- Privacy-focused users who need Incognito
- People in large markets with high user volume
- Couples managing lots of inbound interest
- Selective daters who benefit from filters

**Probably not worth it for:**
- Casual browsers
- Users in smaller cities
- People who haven't optimized their profile yet
- Anyone on a tight budget
- Users just curious about the app

The honest truth: Free Feeld works. People find real connections without paying. Majestic just makes the process faster and more efficient for certain users.

## Getting Better Results (Free or Paid)

Features only matter if your profile and messages work. The best premium subscription can't help a weak profile or boring openers.
