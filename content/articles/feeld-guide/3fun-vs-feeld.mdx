## How Couple Profiles Work

### On 3Fun

## For Different Goals

### If You Want a One-Time Threesome

**3Fun:** Direct path. Everyone's here for the same thing. Less pretense.

**Feeld:** Works too, but you'll encounter people seeking more than hookups.

**Better choice:** 3Fun if speed matters; Feeld if you want better quality interactions

### If You Want an Ongoing Third

**3Fun:** Possible, but the app culture skews casual. Many users aren't seeking ongoing.

**Feeld:** Better suited. User base includes people seeking relationships, not just encounters.

**Better choice:** Feeld

### If You Want to Date Another Couple

**3Fun:** Has couple-matching features. Purpose-built for this.

**Feeld:** Works well with Desires signaling. Quality tends higher.

**Better choice:** Try both; Feeld often has more committed couple users

### If You're New to This

**3Fun:** Steep learning curve in terms of culture. Can feel overwhelming.

**Feeld:** More forgiving. User base tends to be more patient with newcomers.

**Better choice:** Feeld

## Communication Differences

### 3Fun Messaging

**The experience:**
- Often very direct/sexual from the start
- Less emphasis on getting to know each other
- Higher flake rate (matches that never respond)
- Conversations can feel like negotiations

### Feeld Messaging

**The experience:**
- More variety in conversation style
- Room for connection-building
- Lower flake rate generally
- People more likely to follow through

---

## Quality and Safety

### 3Fun

**Reality:**
- Significant bot/fake profile problem
- Inconsistent verification
- Some scam accounts
- Quality varies widely
- Need good judgment filtering

### Feeld

**Reality:**
- Better moderation generally
- Verification options available
- Fewer obvious fakes
- User base self-polices somewhat
- Still requires judgment, but less filtering

---

## Privacy Comparison

### 3Fun Privacy

- Basic hide features
- Can limit profile visibility
- No advanced privacy modes
- Discrete-ish but not robust

### Feeld Privacy

- Incognito mode (premium)—only visible to people you like
- Strong privacy controls
- Better for people with discretion needs
- Hide from contacts possible

**For discretion:** Feeld wins with Incognito mode

---

## Cost Comparison

### 3Fun Pricing

**Free:**
- Basic swiping
- Limited likes
- Messaging with matches

**Premium:**
- See who liked you
- Unlimited likes
- Advanced filters
- Typically $15-25/month

### Feeld Pricing

**Free:**
- Basic swiping and matching
- Limited daily likes
- Messaging

**Majestic:**
- See who liked you
- Advanced filters
- Incognito mode
- More pings
- Typically $15-30/month

**Similar pricing, different value:** Feeld's premium features (especially Incognito) offer more unique value.

---

## The Flake Factor

Let's be honest about one of the biggest differences:

### 3Fun Flakiness

- Higher rate of matches that never respond
- More "maybe" conversations that go nowhere
- People browsing without serious intent
- Fantasy vs. reality gap

### Feeld Flakiness

- Still happens (it's dating apps after all)
- But lower rate overall
- More people follow through
- Expectations are clearer

**Why this matters:** Your time is limited. Lower flake rates mean more actual connections.
