You swiped right, they swiped right—you matched! And then... nothing. No message, no conversation, no connection.

If your match list is full of silent connections, here's why it's happening and how to change it.

---

## Why Matches Don't Message

### Reason 1: They're Waiting for You

**The mutual wait:**
- They matched and expected you to message first
- You matched and expected them to message first
- Neither person takes initiative
- Match expires in silence

**The reality:** On Feeld, there's no "women message first" rule. Either person can—and should—initiate.

### Reason 2: Swipe Fatigue

**What happens:**
- They swiped right on many profiles
- Matches accumulate faster than they can message
- Your match gets lost in the stack
- They forget why they matched with you

**The lesson:** Timing matters. Message while you're fresh in their mind.

### Reason 3: Changed Mind

**Between swiping and matching:**
- They looked at your profile again more carefully
- Enthusiasm faded
- Something in your profile gave them pause
- They're no longer sure they want to connect

### Reason 4: Life Got Busy

**Non-dating reasons:**
- Work crisis
- Family obligation
- Mental health break from dating
- They opened the app, matched, then got pulled away

### Reason 5: Analysis Paralysis

**They want to message but:**
- Don't know what to say
- Feel pressure to be clever
- Overthinking the opener
- Procrastinating until the moment passes

### Reason 6: App Overwhelm

**For attractive profiles:**
- They have dozens of matches
- Can't possibly message everyone
- You didn't stand out enough
- They're prioritizing existing conversations

## The Data on Who Messages First

### General Patterns

**On Feeld:**
- Either gender can message first (no Bumble-style restrictions)
- The person who messages first often gets responses
- Waiting means competing with newer matches
- Initiators have more success than waiters

### What This Means for You

**Stop waiting:**
- If you want to talk to someone, message them
- Don't play games about who should go first
- First-movers get conversations; waiters get silence

## Strategies to Get More Responses

### Strategy 1: Message First, Every Time

**Make it your policy:**
- Match → immediate message (or within hours)
- Don't wait to see if they'll reach out
- Your job is to initiate, not wait

**This alone will transform your match-to-conversation rate.**

### Strategy 2: Message Quickly

**Timing matters:**
- Message within 24 hours of matching
- Ideally within a few hours
- While your profile is fresh in their mind
- Before they match with 10 more people

**Fast messaging:**
- Shows genuine interest
- Catches them while still engaged
- Beats the competition
- Starts momentum

### Strategy 3: Personalized Openers

**Generic openers get ignored:**
- "Hey" is forgettable
- "How are you?" requires effort with no payoff
- Copy-paste messages feel impersonal

**Personalized openers get responses:**
- Reference something specific from their profile
- Ask about something they mentioned
- Show you actually looked at who they are

### Strategy 4: Give Them Something to Respond To

**Make responding easy:**
- Ask a specific question
- Comment on something with a clear follow-up
- Give them a hook to grab

**Bad:** "Nice profile!"
**Better:** "Your mention of competitive Scrabble got me curious—what's your highest-scoring word ever?"

### Strategy 5: Be Interesting From Message One

**Your opener should:**
- Show personality
- Create curiosity
- Invite response
- Not feel like work to reply to

---

## What Your Message Should Include

### The Element of Specificity

**Show you read their profile:**
- "I noticed you mentioned..."
- "Your photo at [place]..."
- "You said you're into [interest]..."

This immediately sets you apart from generic messages.

### A Question or Invitation

**Give them something to respond to:**
- A question about themselves
- A topic to discuss
- An opinion to share
- Something easy to reply to

### Your Personality

**Let them see who you are:**
- Your sense of humor (if appropriate)
- Your genuine interest
- Your communication style
- Something that makes you memorable

### Appropriate Length

**The Goldilocks zone:**
- Not too short (low effort signal)
- Not too long (overwhelming)
- 2-4 sentences is usually right
- Enough to be substantive, brief enough to read

## Example Openers That Get Responses

### Interest-Based

> "Fellow board game enthusiast here. What's the last game you got really into? I've been on a card game kick lately."

### Profile Reference

> "Your bio mentions you're new to ENM—how's the exploration going? I remember that phase being both exciting and overwhelming."

### Curiosity-Driven

> "I'm curious about your travel photo in what looks like [place]. What brought you there?"

### Playful

> "Your profile gives off 'good conversation over wine' energy. Am I reading that right, or are you more of a 'debate over tacos' person?"

### Direct

> "I liked your profile enough to message first. What made you swipe right on mine?"

## When They Still Don't Respond

### Possibility 1: Give It Time

**Wait 3-5 days:**
- They may be busy
- App notifications vary
- Life happens
- Some people batch their responses

### Possibility 2: One Follow-Up

**After a few days, you can try:**
> "Hey, wanted to try one more time before assuming we're not connecting. Still interested in chatting if you are!"

**Rules:**
- Only one follow-up
- Don't be aggressive or guilt-tripping
- Acknowledge the situation casually
- Accept if they still don't respond

### Possibility 3: Move On

**After one follow-up with no response:**
- They're not interested
- Unmatch if you want a cleaner match list
- Or just leave it (they might come back)
- Don't keep messaging

### What Not to Do

**Never:**
- Send multiple follow-up messages
- Get angry or demand response
- Make it about what they "owe" you
- Turn hostile because you're hurt

## Improving Your Match-to-Conversation Rate

### Review Your Profile

**Maybe the issue is what they see after matching:**
- Is your profile compelling?
- Would you message yourself?
- Any red flags or turnoffs?
- Does your profile invite conversation?

### Check Your Photo Lineup

**First impressions matter:**
- Is your first photo your best?
- Do your photos tell a story?
- Are you presenting your best self?
- Anything that might give pause on second look?

### Assess Your Bio

**Is it message-worthy?**
- Does it give conversation hooks?
- Is it interesting enough to inspire contact?
- Does it show personality?
- Any turnoffs hiding in there?

### Consider Your Desires

**Misaligned desires might cause hesitation:**
- Too many? Might seem like you want everything
- Too few? Might seem limited
- Anything that conflicts with what they want?

## The Numbers Game Perspective

### Accept Some Silence

**Reality of dating apps:**
- Not everyone you match with will become a conversation
- Maybe 30-50% response rate is good
- Some matches are never going to pan out
- Quality over quantity

### Focus on What You Control

**You control:**
- Whether you message
- When you message
- What you say
- How you follow up

**You don't control:**
- Whether they respond
- Why they swiped right
- What's going on in their life
- Their interest level

### Improve the Controllables

Better messages → better response rates → more conversations → more connections

## FAQ

**How long should I wait before messaging?**
Don't wait. Message as soon as you match or within a few hours. There's no "playing it cool" benefit on dating apps.

**What if messaging first feels desperate?**
It's not desperate—it's interested. Waiting and hoping is actually less confident than taking initiative.

**Should I unmatch people who don't respond?**
Up to you. Some people clean their match list; others leave it. Occasionally someone responds weeks later. Do what feels right.

**What if I don't know what to say?**
Read their profile and find something to comment on or ask about. If there's nothing, that might tell you something about compatibility anyway.
