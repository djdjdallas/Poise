Not getting matches on Feeld? You're not alone. Unlike mainstream apps like Tinder, Feeld's algorithm works differently—and understanding how it works can dramatically change your experience.

Feeld doesn't publicly share exactly how their matching algorithm works (no dating app does), but through user experience, testing, and patterns, we can piece together what matters. This guide breaks down everything we know about how Feeld decides who sees your profile and who you see.

## How Feeld's Discovery Feed Works

When you open Feeld and start browsing, you're looking at what's called the Discovery feed. This is where the algorithm decides which profiles to show you and in what order.

Feeld uses a queue-based system rather than a score-based one. Here's what that means:

- **Queue-based:** Profiles are lined up for you to see, and the algorithm decides the order
- **Not infinite scrolling:** Unlike some apps, Feeld may run out of profiles to show you in a session
- **Location-influenced:** Geography matters heavily—nearby profiles are prioritized

The Discovery feed isn't random. Feeld's algorithm weighs several factors to decide which profiles appear first.

## What Affects Your Visibility

Your visibility—how often your profile gets shown to others—depends on several key factors:

### 1. Activity Level

The single biggest factor affecting your visibility is how active you are on the app.

**What counts as activity:**
- Opening the app
- Swiping (liking or passing)
- Sending messages
- Updating your profile
- Uploading new photos

**The pattern:** Active users get shown more. If you haven't opened Feeld in a week, your profile drops in priority. If you're on daily, you're more visible.

**Why this matters:** Feeld wants to show users profiles of people who will actually respond. Inactive profiles create bad experiences, so the algorithm deprioritizes them.

### 2. Profile Completeness

Incomplete profiles get less visibility. Feeld rewards profiles that give others something to engage with.

**What "complete" means:**
- All photo slots filled (aim for 4+)
- Bio written (not just a few words)
- Desires selected
- Interests chosen
- Basic details filled in (age, location, etc.)

A profile with one photo and no bio might as well be invisible. The algorithm knows these profiles convert poorly to matches, so it doesn't prioritize showing them.

### 3. Photo Quality and Engagement

While we can't confirm Feeld uses AI photo analysis, there's evidence that photos matter beyond just having them:

- **Clear face photos:** Profiles with visible faces perform better
- **Multiple photos:** More photos = more complete = more visibility
- **Variety:** Different angles, settings, and moods help
- **Authentic:** Overly polished or stock-looking photos may not perform as well

### 4. Your Swipe Patterns

How you swipe affects what you see and who sees you.

**Right-swiping on everyone:** If you like every profile, the algorithm may interpret this as low engagement and show you to fewer people. Quality matters.

**Being selective:** Moderate selectivity signals genuine engagement, which the algorithm rewards.

**Completing sessions:** Swiping through your entire queue regularly keeps you active and visible.

### 5. Response Rate

If you get matches but never message anyone (or never respond to messages), this can affect your visibility negatively. Feeld wants to create connections, not collect matches that go nowhere.

## Why You Might Not Be Getting Matches

If your match count is low or zero, here are the most common reasons:

### Your Location

Feeld's user base is concentrated in larger cities and urban areas. If you're in a smaller town or rural area, there simply might not be many users near you.

**Check this by:** Adjusting your distance settings to see if there are more profiles farther away.

### Your Profile Isn't Complete

This is the most fixable issue. An incomplete profile gets buried by the algorithm.

**Quick audit:**
- Do you have at least 4 photos?
- Is your bio more than one sentence?
- Have you selected desires and interests?
- Are your settings (age range, distance) reasonable?

### You're Too Selective

If you're only liking 1 in 100 profiles, your chances of matching are mathematically low. This isn't about lowering standards—it's about being realistic about match rates.

### You're Not Selective Enough

Conversely, if you're right-swiping everyone, the algorithm may deprioritize you. Find a balance.

### Your Photos Aren't Working

Feeld's audience has different expectations than mainstream apps. What works on Tinder might not work on Feeld.

**Feeld photo tips:**
- Show personality, not just attractiveness
- Include full-body photos, not just face close-ups
- Avoid gym selfies and bathroom mirrors
- Consider photos that hint at your interests/lifestyle

### New Account Adjustment Period

New accounts often get a visibility boost initially (the "newbie boost"), then settle into normal patterns. If matches dropped after your first week, this might be why—your baseline is being established.

## Profile Optimization for the Algorithm

Here's how to optimize your profile specifically for Feeld's algorithm:

### Complete Every Section

This can't be stressed enough. A complete profile signals seriousness to both the algorithm and potential matches.

### Write a Real Bio

Your bio should:
- Be at least 2-3 sentences
- Include something unique about you
- Give people a reason to message you
- Avoid clichés ("looking for my partner in crime")

### Choose Desires Thoughtfully

Your desires directly affect who sees you. Feeld uses these for matching:

- Be honest about what you're actually looking for
- Don't select everything—focus on genuine interests
- Review and update these periodically

### Update Regularly

Make small changes to your profile weekly:
- Rotate photo order
- Add a new photo occasionally
- Tweak your bio
- Update desires if they've evolved

These updates signal activity to the algorithm.

### Use All Photo Slots

Profiles with more photos perform better. Use 5-6 if possible.

## The Role of Desires and Interests

Feeld's matching is heavily influenced by the Desires and Interests you select.

### How Desires Work

Desires are the core of Feeld's identity. They tell the algorithm what kind of connections you're seeking and help match you with compatible users.

**Examples of desires:**
- Single looking for couples
- Couple looking for singles
- Interested in kink
- Open relationship
- Casual connections

The algorithm prioritizes showing you profiles with compatible desires. If you're a single woman looking for couples, you'll see more couples in your feed.

### How Interests Work

Interests are secondary to desires but still matter. They help surface profiles that share your hobbies, values, or preferences.

**Tip:** Select interests genuinely. Selecting everything dilutes their usefulness for matching.

## Premium (Majestic) vs Free Algorithm Differences

Does paying for Feeld Majestic change the algorithm? Here's what we know. For a complete cost-benefit analysis, see our [Feeld Majestic review](/feeld-guide/feeld-premium-worth-it).

### Confirmed Differences

- **Queue priority:** Majestic members may appear higher in others' Discovery feeds
- **More visibility:** Premium profiles get shown to more people
- **See who liked you:** Knowing who's interested lets you prioritize effectively

### Unconfirmed but Likely

- **Faster visibility updates:** Profile changes may propagate faster
- **Less throttling:** Free users may face more limits on daily visibility

### What Majestic Doesn't Change

- **Your photos still matter:** Premium won't fix bad photos
- **Your bio still matters:** A complete profile is still essential
- **Activity still matters:** Paying won't help if you're never on the app

**Bottom line:** Majestic can boost visibility, but it won't compensate for a weak profile. Fix fundamentals first.

## Timing and Activity Patterns

When you use Feeld matters:

### Peak Usage Times

Feeld users tend to be most active:
- Evenings (7pm-11pm local time)
- Weekends, especially Sunday evenings
- Late nights (for certain demographics)

Being active during peak times means you're engaging when others are online, which can boost mutual visibility.

### Consistent Activity Beats Sporadic Bursts

Opening Feeld for 10 minutes every day is better for the algorithm than one 2-hour session per week. The algorithm favors consistent engagement.

### Location Updates

Feeld uses your location to show you nearby profiles. If you travel or move, your location updates can trigger a fresh set of profiles (and fresh visibility to local users).

## Boosting Your Match Rate

Practical steps to get more matches, ranked by impact:

### High Impact

1. **Complete your profile 100%** — Do this today if you haven't
2. **Add high-quality, authentic photos** — Aim for 5-6
3. **Write a compelling bio** — Give people a reason to engage
4. **Be active daily** — Even 5 minutes matters

### Medium Impact

5. **Select desires thoughtfully** — Accuracy over quantity
6. **Use pings strategically** — For profiles you're genuinely excited about
7. **Be selective but not too selective** — Find your balance
8. **Respond to matches** — Keep your response rate healthy

### Lower Impact (But Still Helps)

9. **Update profile weekly** — Small changes keep you fresh
10. **Try different peak times** — Experiment with when you're active
11. **Consider Majestic** — If other factors are optimized

## Common Algorithm Myths

### Myth: "Feeld shadowbanned me"

True shadowbans are rare. What people often experience is natural visibility decline due to inactivity or an exhausted local pool of profiles.

### Myth: "The algorithm hates me"

The algorithm doesn't target individuals. If you're not getting matches, it's almost always profile issues, location, or activity patterns.

### Myth: "Paying guarantees matches"

Majestic improves visibility, not attractiveness. If your profile isn't working, premium won't fix it.

### Myth: "New accounts always get boosted"

There's some evidence of new account visibility bumps, but it's not dramatic or long-lasting. Don't create new accounts expecting magic.

---

## When to Reset

Sometimes, starting fresh makes sense. Consider creating a new account if:

- Your old account has significant profile issues you've since fixed
- You've moved to a new city
- It's been years since you last used Feeld actively
- You have clear evidence of technical issues (contact support first)

**Warning:** Don't reset just because you're not getting matches. Fix your current profile first. Frequent resets can actually trigger anti-spam measures.

## Struggling to Get Matches?

The algorithm can only do so much. What really matters is your profile—and specifically, how you present yourself through photos, bio, and messages.

Poise helps you craft profiles that attract the right people and write openers that actually get responses. Instead of fighting the algorithm, build a profile the algorithm wants to show.
