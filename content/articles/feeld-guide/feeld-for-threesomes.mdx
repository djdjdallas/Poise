## For Couples Seeking a Third

### Profile Setup

**Your couple profile should:**
- Show both partners clearly
- Demonstrate both are enthusiastic
- Be honest about what you're seeking
- Treat the third as a person, not accessory

**Include:**
- Individual photos of each partner
- Couple photos showing dynamic
- What you're looking for
- What you offer to the third

### Avoiding "Unicorn Hunter" Reputation

**The term exists because:**
- Many couples treat thirds poorly
- Focus on what they want, not give
- Seek impossible fantasy person
- Don't consider third's experience

**Do better by:**
- Treating thirds as full people
- Considering what you offer them
- Being flexible on their needs
- Not having impossible standards

### What You Offer Matters

**Think about:**
- What's in it for the third?
- Why would someone want to join you?
- What makes your offer attractive?
- How will you make it good for them?

### Messaging as a Couple

**Good approach:**
- Both partners engage (or make clear who's messaging)
- Genuine interest in the person
- Not just "we think you're hot"
- Ask about their experience and desires

## For Individuals Open to Joining

### Profile Setup

**If you're open to couples:**
- Mention it in your profile
- Be clear about what you're seeking

- Both partners seem enthusiastic
- They treat you as a person
- Clear communication
- Equal interest from both

**Red flags:**
- One partner seems uninvolved
- They see you as accessory
- Pushy or demanding
- Won't answer questions

### Knowing Your Worth

**Remember:**
- You're in demand
- You get to have standards
- Your experience matters
- You can say no

### Asking the Right Questions

**Find out:**
- Have they done this before?
- What are they looking for?
- How do they handle things if one person is uncomfortable?
- What are their expectations?

## Common Mistakes

### Couples: Treating Third as Disposable

**Problem:** Use and discard mentality
**Better:** Treat as person, follow up appropriately, be respectful

### Couples: One Partner Not Really Into It

**Problem:** Pressure to participate
**Better:** Only proceed if both genuinely want it

### Third: Ignoring Red Flags

**Problem:** Going ahead despite concerns
**Better:** Trust your instincts, walk away if something's off

### Everyone: No Communication

**Problem:** Assuming things will work out
**Better:** Explicit discussion before, during, and after
