"Hey" doesn't work. Neither does "I love your profile" with nothing specific attached. On Feeld, where people receive more messages than average dating apps, your opener needs to stand out—without being try-hard or creepy.

Here are 30 conversation starters that actually get responses, organized by situation.

## The Principles Behind Good Openers

Before the templates, understand why they work:

**Specificity**: Reference something unique to their profile
**Curiosity**: Ask something they'll want to answer
**Low pressure**: Don't demand immediate commitment to anything
**Personality**: Show who you are, not just what you want

Now, the starters.

## For Profiles with Clear Interests (10 Starters)

When they've shared hobbies, passions, or specific details:

**1. The Genuine Question**
> "Your profile mentions [specific interest]. I'm curious—how did you get into that?"

**2. The Shared Interest**
> "Another [hobby] person! What's your favorite [specific aspect]?"

**3. The Playful Challenge**
> "I see you're into [interest]. Hot take: [mild opinion]. Agree or fight me?"

**4. The Recommendation Ask**
> "You mentioned loving [category]. I'm looking for new [books/shows/music/etc.]. What's something underrated you'd recommend?"

**5. The Story Prompt**
> "That photo of you [doing something] looks like there's a story behind it. Am I right?"

**6. The Compliment + Question**
> "Your taste in [thing] is excellent. What got you into [specific item they mentioned]?"

**7. The Connection**
> "I also [shared experience]. Did you find that [relevant question]?"

**8. The Observation**
> "Your profile gives off [specific vibe—thoughtful/adventurous/creative]. Is that accurate, or am I projecting?"

**9. The Recent Event**
> "Did you catch [relevant event related to their interest]? Curious what you thought."

**10. The Deeper Dive**
> "Most people who like [interest] are into [common thing]. Are you the same, or do you go against the grain?"

## For Minimal Profiles (5 Starters)

When there's not much to work with:

**11. The Photo-Based**
> "That [specific photo detail—location, item, expression] caught my attention. What's the context?"

**12. The Desire-Based**
> "I noticed we both have [shared desire] listed. What does that look like for you?"

**13. The Direct Curiosity**
> "Your profile is pretty minimal—intentional mystery, or just haven't gotten around to filling it out?"

**14. The Assumption Check**
> "I'm getting [specific vibe] from your profile. Am I reading that right?"

**15. The Simple Invite**
> "Not much to go on here, but I'm intrigued. What's something you wish people asked you about?"

## For Couples (5 Starters)

When you're messaging a couple profile:

**16. The Inclusive**
> "Hey both! Your profile mentions [thing]. Which of you is more into that, or is it equal?"

**17. The Dynamic Curious**
> "I love that you're on here together. How long have you been exploring, and what's been the best part?"

**18. The Specific to Them**
> "You two seem [observation—fun/thoughtful/adventurous]. What made you decide to try Feeld?"

**19. The Playful**
> "Okay, important question: Do you agree on [lighthearted topic from their profile], or is this a source of debate?"

**20. The Direct Interest**
> "I'm drawn to couples who [thing that applies to them]. What are you hoping to find here?"

## For ENM/Poly Profiles (5 Starters)

When their profile indicates non-monogamy:

**21. The Fellow Traveler**
> "Always nice to see fellow [ENM/poly] people. How long have you been practicing, and what's your structure like?"

**22. The Approach Question**
> "Your profile mentions [specific ENM style]. I'm curious how you came to that structure."

**23. The Values Check**
> "What drew you to ENM? I always find people's origin stories interesting."

**24. The Practical**
> "I see you have [partner situation]. What are you hoping to add to your life right now?"

**25. The Casual Connect**
> "Another poly person navigating dating apps! What's been your experience on Feeld so far?"

## For Kink-Curious Conversations (5 Starters)

When their desires suggest kink interests:

**26. The Gentle Probe**
> "I noticed [desire] on your profile. Is that something you're actively exploring, or more curious about?"

**27. The Shared Interest**
> "We have [kink/desire] in common. What draws you to that?"

**28. The Experience Question**
> "Your desires are intriguing. Are you more experienced or exploring these interests?"

**29. The Dynamic Opener**
> "I'm drawn to [thing on their profile]. What does that look like for you in practice?"

**30. The Respectful Direct**
> "I'd love to know more about what you're looking for—your profile hints at some interesting possibilities."

## What Makes These Work

### They're Specific
Generic openers get generic responses (or none). These reference actual profile content.

### They Invite Conversation
Each one asks something the person can easily respond to. Not yes/no questions, but prompts that invite sharing.

### They Show Personality
The way you ask reveals something about you. Curiosity, humor, directness—whatever your style is, let it show.

### They're Low Pressure
No one is asked to commit to anything, share personal information, or respond urgently.

## Adapting to Your Style

These are templates, not scripts. Adjust them to sound like you:

**If you're more casual**: Shorten and simplify
**If you're more formal**: Add a bit more context
**If you're funny**: Add your humor
**If you're direct**: Cut the softening language

The worst opener is one that doesn't sound like you. People will eventually meet the real you—start there.

## What NOT to Open With

For contrast, avoid:

- **"Hey" or "Hi"** (zero effort)
- **"You're hot/beautiful/sexy"** (doesn't invite conversation)
- **Generic compliments** without specificity
- **Immediately sexual** content before rapport
- **Your entire life story** in message one
- **Demands** ("Tell me about yourself")
- **Negativity** ("Nobody ever responds to me")

## After the Opener

A good opener only matters if you can continue the conversation:

- Actually respond to what they share
- Ask follow-up questions based on their answers
- Share relevant things about yourself
- Let conversation flow naturally before suggesting meeting

The opener opens. What you do next determines whether it goes anywhere.

## FAQ

**How long should my first message be?**
2-4 sentences. Long enough to show effort, short enough to be read easily.

**Should I always ask a question?**
Usually. Questions invite response. Statements can work if they're compelling, but questions are safer.

**What if they don't respond?**
Move on. Don't send follow-ups or take it personally. Not everyone is active, interested, or available.

**Can I use the same opener for multiple people?**
Only if it's genuinely relevant to each profile. Copy-paste generic openers are obvious and off-putting.
