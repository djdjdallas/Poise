## Getting Good Photos

### Take New Ones

**If your photos are lacking:**
- Ask a friend to take some
- Use timer/tripod
- Good lighting + good outfit + relaxed expression
- Take many, select few

### Use What You Have Wisely

**From existing photos:**
- Crop strategically
- Choose most recent
- Variety of contexts
- Represent current you

### Professional Photoshoots

**Worth considering if:**
- You have no good photos
- You're serious about dating
- You want high-quality options
- But make them look natural, not headshots

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Group Photos

**Problems:**

- One small face photo at most, if needed

### Old Photos

### Heavily Filtered/Edited

**Avoid:**

### No Variety

**Problematic:**

## Updating Your Photos

### Testing What Works

**Try:**

- Different photo orders
- Adding/removing specific photos
- Noticing what generates matches

## FAQ

**How many photos should I have?**
4-6 is ideal. Enough for variety, not so many that quality drops. All photos should add something.

**Should I include photos with other people?**
Sparingly, if at all. One group photo is okay. But the focus should be on you.

**Are mirror selfies okay?**
Not ideal, but better than no full body shot. If you use one, make it good quality with clean background.

**Should I include funny/meme photos?**
If it represents your personality, maybe one. But make sure core photos are clear representations of you.
