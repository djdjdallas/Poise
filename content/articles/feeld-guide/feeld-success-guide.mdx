## Profile Optimization

### Photos That Work

**Best practices:**
- Clear face shot as first photo
- Mix of close-up and full-body
- Show personality and interests
- Good lighting and quality
- Authentic (not overly edited)

**What to avoid:**
- All group photos
- Blurry or dark images
- Only selfies
- Misleading photos
- Too many filters

**For couples:**
- Photos of both people
- Individual shots too
- Show your connection
- Don't hide faces if possible

### Writing Your Bio

**Essential elements:**
- What you're looking for
- Your relationship status/structure
- Key interests or personality
- What makes you unique
- Conversation hooks

**Bio structure that works:**
1. Opening hook (personality/humor)
2. What you're seeking
3. Relationship context (if relevant)
4. Interests/passions
5. Conversation starter

**Example:**
> Coffee snob, book hoarder, terrible dancer. Happily partnered and exploring connections with curious, communicative people. Looking for spark and substance—not just small talk. Tell me about the last thing that made you laugh out loud.

### Using Desires Strategically

**Select desires that:**
- Accurately represent your interests
- Signal what you're seeking
- Help matching algorithm
- Spark conversation

**Don't:**
- Select everything
- List things you're only curious about as strong interests
- Ignore this section

### Feeld-Specific Profile Fields

**Fill out:**
- Sexuality orientation accurately
- Gender identity
- Relationship status
- What you're looking for
- Age and location

**Linking profiles (couples):**
- Both partners should have profiles
- Link for couple matching
- Can also be discovered individually
- Communicate about how you want to appear

## Matching Strategy

### Swiping Smart

**Quality approach:**
- Read profiles, don't just swipe
- Look for compatibility signals
- Check desires alignment
- Consider conversation potential

**Don't:**
- Swipe right on everyone
- Swipe based only on photos
- Rush through profiles
- Ignore red flags

### Understanding the Algorithm

**What seems to help:**
- Regular activity
- Completing your profile
- Being selective (not swiping right on everyone)
- Engaging with matches

**Boost visibility:**
- Activity begets activity
- Update profile periodically
- Use Feeld at peak times
- Consider premium features

## Messaging That Connects

### Opening Messages

**Good openers:**
- Reference something specific from their profile
- Ask an engaging question
- Show personality
- Give them something to respond to

**Examples:**
> "Your bio mentions you're learning pottery—what made you start? I've always been curious but intimidated by the wheel."

> "Fellow board game enthusiast! What's your current favorite? I've been on a Wingspan kick lately."

**Avoid:**
- "Hey" or "Hi"
- Generic compliments
- Copy-paste messages
- Sexual opener (unless profile invites it)

### Keeping Conversations Going

**Maintain momentum:**
- Ask follow-up questions
- Share relevant things about yourself
- Keep message length balanced
- Don't let days pass between responses

**Conversation flow:**
- Opening exchange (2-3 messages)
- Deeper connection (3-5 messages)
- Move toward meeting (2-3 messages)
- Roughly 7-10 messages to date suggestion

### Moving to Meeting

**When to suggest:**
- Conversation is flowing
- Mutual interest clear
- Before conversation stagnates
- Within a week ideally

**How to ask:**
> "I'm really enjoying this conversation. Would you want to continue it over coffee or drinks this week?"

> "You seem like someone I'd love to meet in person. Are you free for a drink [specific day]?"

## FAQ

**Is Feeld worth the premium subscription?**
If you're actively using the app and serious about connections, premium features like seeing who likes you can be valuable. Test free version first.

**Why am I not getting matches?**
Profile quality is usually the issue. Get honest feedback on photos and bio. Location matters too—smaller areas have fewer users.

**How long should I talk before meeting?**
Generally, a week or so of messaging is plenty. Long conversations often fizzle. Move to meeting while interest is high.

No. Many users seek relationships, dating, and meaningful connections. Be clear about what you want; you'll find others seeking similar.
