## Profile Red Flags

### Photo Warning Signs

**Single photo only:**
- One perfect photo = suspicious
- Real people have multiple angles
- Exception: Very new users

**Too professional:**
- Stock photo quality
- Heavy editing or filters
- No casual photos

**Inconsistent:**
- Photos look like different people
- Age seems different across photos
- Background/setting inconsistencies

**Reverse image searchable:**
- Use Google Lens or TinEye
- If photos appear elsewhere online, likely fake

### Bio Warning Signs

**Generic or empty:**
- "Just ask" with nothing else
- Copy-pasted generic text
- No specific interests listed

**Too good to be true:**
- Matches every possible desire
- Suspiciously perfect compatibility
- Reads like a fantasy checklist

**Grammar and syntax:**
- Clearly translated text
- Unusual phrasing patterns
- Inconsistent writing quality

### Account Age Indicators

**New account + aggressive messaging:**
- Created recently
- Immediately pushing to meet or move platforms
- No community connection

---

## Messaging Red Flags

### Bot Behavior

**Immediate response:**
- Replies instantly at any hour
- Messages don't reference what you said
- Generic compliments

**Scripted patterns:**
> You: "Hi, how was your weekend?"
> Them: "I'm looking for a serious connection. Are you real?"

**Link pushing:**
- "Let's continue on [external site]"
- "Verify yourself at [link]"
- "I'm more active on [platform]"

### Scammer Behavior

**Love bombing:**
- Intense affection immediately
- "I've never felt this connection"
- Fast-tracking emotional intimacy

**Avoiding verification:**
- Excuses for no video call
- Won't meet in public
- Camera always "broken"

**Eventually asks for:**
- Money for emergency
- Gift cards
- Investment opportunities
- Personal financial info

### Catfish Behavior

**Vague about details:**

- Avoids video calls
- Always has reason not to meet

- Contradicts previous statements
- Vague about work/location

## How to Verify Someone

### Basic Checks

**Reverse image search:**
1. Screenshot their photos
2. Upload to Google Lens or TinEye
3. If photos appear elsewhere, question authenticity

**Social media consistency:**
- If they share other profiles, check them
- Does their story match?
- Are the profiles established or new?

### Conversation Tests

**Ask specific questions:**
> "What's your favorite restaurant near where you mentioned you live?"

Real people have specific answers. Fakes give generic responses.

**Reference something from their profile:**
> "You mentioned you like hiking—what's the best trail you've done recently?"

**Notice response timing:**
- Real people have inconsistent response times
- Bots respond instantly or at predictable intervals

### Video Verification

**Request a brief video call:**
> "Before we meet, I'd feel more comfortable doing a quick video chat. Are you free for 10 minutes sometime?"

**During the call:**
- Do they look like their photos?
- Are they responsive to conversation?
- Does anything feel off?

**If they refuse:**
> "I understand privacy concerns, but a video call is pretty standard before meeting. If that doesn't work for you, we might not be a good match."

## The 5-Minute Reality Check

Before investing more time:

**1. Photos (1 minute):**
- Multiple photos showing same person?
- Varied settings and angles?
- Nothing searchable online?

**2. Bio (30 seconds):**
- Specific interests listed?
- Written like a real person?
- Nothing too generic?

**3. Conversation (2 minutes):**
- Responses reference what you said?
- Shares specific details about life?
- Consistent information?

**4. Verification (1.5 minutes):**
- Willing to video call?
- No pressure to move platforms?
- No requests for money/info?

## Common Scam Scripts

### The "Verification" Scam

> "Feeld requires verification. Click this link to verify you're real."

**Reality:** Feeld doesn't do this. It's a phishing attempt.

### The "Off Platform" Push

> "I'm more active on [WhatsApp/Telegram/etc]. Let's talk there instead."

**Reality:** Could be legitimate, but often used to evade platform moderation.

### The Romance Scam

> "I feel such a strong connection with you. I'm in a difficult situation and need help..."

**Reality:** Building emotional connection to eventually request money.

### The Investment Scam

> "I've been doing really well with crypto/trading. I could show you..."

**Reality:** "Pig butchering" scam—will eventually steal your money.
