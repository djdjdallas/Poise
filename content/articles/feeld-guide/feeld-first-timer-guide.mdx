## Before You Download

### Make Sure You're Ready

Before joining Feeld, honestly assess:
- **Do you understand ENM?** Basic knowledge of non-monogamy is expected
- **Have you done the work?** Read books, had conversations, understood yourself
- **Are any partners on board?** If partnered, everyone should be informed and consenting
- **What are you looking for?** Have some idea before you start

### If You're Partnered

Questions to settle first:
- What kinds of connections are you each seeking?
- Are you dating together, separately, or both?
- What boundaries have you agreed on?
- How will you communicate about dates/matches?

### If You're Single

Think about:
- What relationship structure appeals to you?
- What are you hoping to find?
- How will you navigate partnered people?
- What boundaries matter to you?

## Setting Up Your Profile

### The Basics

**Photos:**
- Multiple clear photos showing your face
- At least one solo photo
- Show your personality
- If coupled, include couple photo if you're seeking together

**Desires:**
- Be honest about what you're seeking
- Better to be specific than vague
- Update as you learn what you want

### Writing Your Bio

**Include:**
- Your relationship structure (solo poly, partnered, etc.)
- What you're looking for
- Something about who you are beyond dating
- Any dealbreakers or important info

**Example structure:**
> [Your relationship style]. Looking for [what you want].
>
> [Something interesting about you].
>
> [Any important notes - partner info, must-haves, etc.]

### Common Newcomer Mistakes

**Too vague:**
> "Just seeing what's out there"

**Better:**
> "Newly exploring ENM, looking for meaningful connections and people who enjoy good conversation."

**Overly complicated:**
> "Looking for a unicorn or maybe a couple or possibly a third but also open to solo connections if the vibe is right and you're not too clingy but also not too distant..."

**Better:**
> "Open to various connection types. Let's chat and see if we click."

## Your First Conversations

### Opening Messages

**Do:**
- Reference their profile
- Ask a genuine question
- Be clear about your interest

**Don't:**
- Send just "hey"
- Open with sexual content
- Copy-paste generic messages

**Example opener:**
> "Hi! I saw you're into [interest from their profile]. I'm also interested in that. What got you started? I'm [your name], exploring ENM and seeing who I connect with."

### What to Discuss Early

**Share:**
- Your ENM status/structure
- What you're looking for
- Your experience level
- Basic availability

**Ask:**
- What their structure is
- What they're seeking
- Whether partners know/consent
- What a good connection looks like for them

### Navigating "What Are You Looking For?"

**Honest answers work:**
> "I'm new to ENM and still figuring out exactly what I want. Right now I'm open to meeting people and seeing what develops organically."

> "I'm looking for ongoing connections rather than one-time things, but I'm flexible on what that looks like."

## Common First-Timer Questions

### "Everyone seems experienced. Do I belong here?"

Yes. Everyone started somewhere. What matters is that you:
- Communicate honestly
- Respect boundaries
- Keep learning

Be upfront about your experience level. Many people enjoy connecting with thoughtful newcomers.

### "How do I compete with people who've been doing this for years?"

It's not a competition. Different people want different things. Some specifically prefer dating newer people. Focus on genuine connection, not competing.

### "What if I do something wrong?"

You might make mistakes. The ENM community generally:
- Values intent and accountability
- Appreciates people who learn
- Forgives honest errors, not repeated ones

If you mess up: acknowledge it, learn from it, do better.

### "Is everyone just looking for sex?"

No. Feeld has people seeking everything from casual to committed. Be clear about what you want and filter accordingly.

### "Why isn't anyone responding?"

Possible reasons:
- Feeld is slower-paced than mainstream apps
- ENM people often have full lives
- Your profile may need work
- Timing and luck matter

Don't take it personally. Keep refining your approach.

## Avoiding Common Newcomer Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Not Disclosing Your Situation

If you have a partner, disclose early. "My partner doesn't know" is not ethical non-monogamy.

### Mistake #2: Treating People as Experiments

People on Feeld are whole humans, not tools for your exploration. Approach with genuine interest in them.

### Mistake #3: Going Too Fast

Slow down. Build connection before making big asks. ENM takes patience.

### Mistake #4: Assuming Everyone Wants the Same Thing

Each person has different desires, boundaries, and relationship styles. Ask and listen.

### Mistake #5: Not Doing Emotional Work

ENM requires self-awareness, jealousy management, and communication skills. Keep doing the internal work.

### Mistake #6: Unicorn Hunting (If You're a Couple)

Seeking a "third" while treating them as less-than is a major red flag in ENM circles. Learn about this before approaching single people.
