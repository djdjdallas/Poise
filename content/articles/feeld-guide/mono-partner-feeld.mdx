You've discovered you're interested in ethical non-monogamy. Your partner is firmly monogamous—or at least hasn't considered anything else.

This is delicate territory. Here's how to approach it thoughtfully.

---

## Before You Say Anything

### Check Your Motivations

Ask yourself honestly:
- Do I want polyamory, or am I dissatisfied with this relationship?
- Am I hoping ENM will fix something that's broken?
- Would I still want this if my relationship were perfect?
- Is this about exploration or escape?

**If it's about escape:** Address the relationship issues directly. Don't use ENM as a workaround.

### Understand What You're Asking

Opening up means:
- Potential for your partner to also date others
- Significant relationship renegotiation
- Emotional work for both of you
- Risk to the current relationship

If you want to date others but hope your partner doesn't, that's not ethical.

### Know You Can't Force It

Your partner gets to say no. If they're genuinely not interested, you'll face a choice:
- Stay monogamous
- End the relationship
- (Sometimes) negotiate something both can live with

There's no way to "convince" someone into wanting polyamory.

## Starting the Conversation

### Setting the Stage

**Timing:**
- When you're both calm and connected
- Not during conflict
- With enough time for real conversation
- Privately, without distractions

**Approach:**
- Curious, not demanding
- Open to their reaction
- Without ultimatums
- As an invitation to explore, not a declaration

### Opening Lines

**Inviting exploration:**
> "There's something I've been thinking about that I'd like to share with you. It's not an emergency or a complaint—I've just been exploring some ideas about relationships and I want to talk them through with you."

**Being honest:**
> "I've been curious about non-monogamy. I'm not saying I need to do it or that anything's wrong with us—I'm just curious about it and wanted to be honest with you about that."

**Making it collaborative:**
> "I've been reading about ethical non-monogamy, and some of it resonates with me. I'm wondering if you'd be open to exploring these ideas together, just to see what we each think."

### What Not to Say

**Don't:**
- "I've already downloaded Feeld"
- "I need this or I'll leave"
- "I've always wanted this but never told you"
- "Everyone's doing it now"
- "You're not meeting all my needs"

---

## If They're Curious

### Go Slow

If your partner shows interest:
- Don't rush to create profiles
- Let them process and research
- Answer questions honestly
- Explore together at their pace

### Resources to Share

**Books:**
- *The Ethical Slut*
- *Opening Up*
- *More Than Two*
- *Polysecure*

**Other:**
- Podcasts about ENM
- Articles (like this one)
- Community events (just to learn, not to date)

### Questions to Explore Together

- "What appeals to you about this, if anything?"
- "What concerns you?"
- "What would you need to feel safe?"
- "What boundaries would be important?"

---

## If They're Reluctant

### Listen First

If they're hesitant, understand why:
- Is it fear? Of what specifically?
- Is it values? Do they believe in monogamy deeply?
- Is it confusion? Do they just need more information?
- Is it hurt? Are they feeling rejected by the question?

### Address Their Concerns

**"Am I not enough?"**
> "This isn't about you not being enough. You are. It's about exploring a different relationship structure, not replacing what we have."

**"You just want to cheat with permission"**
> "I understand why it might seem that way. Ethical non-monogamy is different from cheating—it's about honesty and consent. I'm not trying to get away with something."

**"I don't want to share you"**
> "That feeling is valid. I'm not asking you to ignore that feeling. I'm asking if we can talk about this more deeply and see if there's something that could work for both of us."

**"What if you find someone better?"**
> "That fear exists in any relationship. I'm committed to you, and I'd want us to build something that strengthens us, not threatens us."

### What "No" Looks Like

**Firm no:**
> "I've thought about it and I'm not interested. I want to be monogamous."

**If they say this:** Respect it. You can revisit later if they indicate openness, but don't push.

**Unsure no:**
> "I don't think so, but I'd be willing to learn more before deciding."

**If they say this:** Provide resources without pressure. Give them space to process.

## If They Say Yes to Exploring

### Before Downloading Feeld

**Discuss:**
- What are we each looking for?
- What boundaries do we need?
- How will we handle difficult emotions?
- What's our communication plan?

**Prepare:**
- Read resources together
- Talk about jealousy and how you'll handle it
- Agree on how fast or slow to go
- Consider couples counseling for support

### Creating Profiles Together

**Decide:**
- Are you dating together, separately, or both?
- Are you making a shared profile or individual ones?
- What are you each seeking?
- What will you share with each other?

**On Feeld:**
- Be honest about your situation (new to ENM)
- Clarify your structure
- Avoid unicorn-hunting language
- Treat potential matches as full people

## The Gradual Approach

### Not All or Nothing

Opening up can happen in stages:

**Stage 1: Education**
- Reading and discussing
- Attending events (just learning)
- Understanding the lifestyle

**Stage 2: Exploration**
- Creating profiles to see what's out there
- Matching but not meeting
- Getting comfortable with the idea

**Stage 3: Tentative Steps**
- First dates (coffee, casual)
- Processing reactions together
- Adjusting boundaries as needed

**Stage 4: Active ENM**
- Regular dating
- Developing other relationships
- Ongoing renegotiation

### Check-Ins Along the Way

At each stage:
- "How are you feeling about this?"
- "What's working? What isn't?"
- "Do we need to pause or adjust?"
- "Are we still connected?"

---

## If It's Not Working

### Signs to Pause

- One partner is miserable
- Trust is eroding
- Primary relationship is suffering
- Jealousy is overwhelming
- You're not communicating well

### Closing Back Up

It's okay to:
- Take a break
- Slow way down
- Return to monogamy
- Acknowledge this wasn't right for you

Trying ENM and deciding it's not for you isn't failure.

## The Partner's Perspective

### If You're the Reluctant Partner

If your partner asked you to read this:
- Your feelings are valid
- You don't have to want this
- Curiosity isn't commitment
- Your consent matters

### What You Might Ask Your Partner

- "Why do you want this?"
- "What are you hoping to get that you're not getting?"
- "Are you committed to our relationship regardless?"
- "What happens if I can't do this?"
