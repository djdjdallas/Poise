You're heading to a new city and thinking about opening Feeld. Maybe you live somewhere with limited matches. Maybe you want to meet locals. Maybe you're curious what dating looks like in a different place.

Using Feeld while traveling is common, but it requires honesty and intentionality. Here's how to do it right.

## The Ethics of Travel Dating

### Why Honesty Matters

Travelers on dating apps have a reputation problem. Many people have experienced:

- Matches who didn't mention they were leaving in two days
- "I'm just visiting" revealed right before a date
- Connections that felt real, then disappeared
- Feeling used for a vacation hookup

You can be different by being upfront.

### The Principle

**Be as honest with travel matches as you'd be with anyone.**

This means:
- Disclosing that you're traveling (in your profile or early in conversation)
- Being clear about your timeline
- Not misleading people about what's possible
- Treating travel connections with the same respect as local ones

## Setting Up Your Profile

### Updating Your Location

**Feeld allows you to:**
- Use your current location automatically
- Manually set your location to anywhere

**Timing:**
- Update a day or two before you arrive
- This lets you match and start conversations in advance
- People can plan around your schedule

### What to Say in Your Bio

**Clear and honest approaches:**

> "Visiting [city] [dates]. Looking to connect with interesting people while I'm in town. Based in [home city] normally—open to connection that extends beyond the visit if there's chemistry."

> "In [city] for work through [date]. Would love to meet locals, explore the city, and see if there's a spark. Happy to discuss what I'm looking for."

> "Traveling to [city] [dates]. I'm upfront about being a visitor because I know that matters. Looking for genuine connection while I'm here—whatever form that takes."

**Why this works:**
- Sets expectations from the start
- Respects people's time
- Filters for those open to visitors

### Don't Hide It

Some travelers leave their profiles unchanged, planning to mention it "later." This:
- Wastes everyone's time
- Feels deceptive when revealed
- Damages your reputation
- Makes the eventual conversation awkward

Just be upfront.

## Types of Travel Connections

### The Vacation Fling

**What it is:** A short-term connection both people understand has an expiration date.

**Works when:**
- Both parties want something casual
- No one is expecting more
- You're both clear about the timeline
- The connection is fun without future expectations

**How to approach:**
> "I'm here for a week and looking for fun connections without pressure for more. Is that something you'd be interested in?"

### The Local Guide Connection

**What it is:** Meeting someone who can show you their city while you both enjoy each other's company.

**Works when:**
- Genuine mutual interest beyond just "showing around"
- Not treating someone as a service provider
- Offering something in return (your company, your interest, etc.)
- Clear that it's a date, not a tour

### The "Let's See What Happens"

**What it is:** Being open to connection that might extend beyond the visit.

**Works when:**
- You're genuinely open to continuing something long-distance
- You're honest that it's uncertain
- The other person is also open to that possibility

**How to communicate:**
> "I know I'm traveling, but I'm not opposed to ongoing connection if something really clicks. I'm open to seeing what develops."

### Ongoing Travel Connections

**What it is:** Building connections in cities you visit regularly.

**Works when:**
- You genuinely return to the same places
- You maintain connection between visits
- You're honest about the structure

**Example:**
> "I'm in [city] for business about once a month. Looking to build connections here that I can maintain over time, not just one-time meetings."

## Conversation Strategies

### Opening Messages

**Reference your travel:**
> "Hey! I'm visiting [city] next week and your profile caught my eye. I'm interested in meeting locals who are open to connecting with travelers. What do you think?"

**Ask about their comfort:**
> "I noticed you're local—how do you feel about matching with someone who's traveling? I'm here [dates] if you'd be open to meeting."

### Early Conversation Topics

**Address logistical questions:**
- When you're arriving and leaving
- What your schedule looks like
- When you're free to meet
- Whether you're open to connection beyond the trip

**Ask about them:**
- Their connection to the city
- What they're looking for
- If they have experience with travel connections
- What makes connecting worth it for them

### Planning the Date

**Be respectful of their time:**
- You're the visitor; be flexible
- Don't expect them to rearrange their life for your schedule
- Confirm plans clearly (travelers flaking is common)
- Show up when you say you will

## During Your Trip

### Managing Multiple Connections

If you're matching with several people:

**Be honest:**
- You don't have to disclose every match
- But don't imply exclusivity that doesn't exist

**Be realistic:**
- You only have so much time
- Quality over quantity matters
- Spreading too thin serves no one

**Prioritize:**
- Focus on connections with genuine chemistry
- It's okay to not meet everyone you matched with
- Better to have one good experience than five mediocre ones

### Meeting Safely

Standard safety practices plus travel-specific ones:

**General:**
- Meet in public
- Tell someone your plans
- Have your own transportation

**Travel-specific:**
- Know how to get back to your accommodation
- Have the hotel/Airbnb address accessible
- Understand local transportation options
- Don't get too intoxicated in an unfamiliar place

### Respecting Boundaries

When you're a visitor:

**Don't:**
- Pressure for immediate meetups because "I'm only here for two days"
- Use limited time as manipulation
- Expect people to drop everything for you
- Get pushy about coming to their place

**Do:**
- Accept if someone can't meet during your window
- Respect their schedule and comfort
- Understand you're the one with constraints, not them
- Be gracious about timing that doesn't work out

## After the Trip

### Handling Departures

**If it was clearly casual:**
- A simple "thanks for a great time" is sufficient
- No need to pretend at future connection
- Kind closure is fine

**If there was real chemistry:**
- Discuss what (if anything) comes next
- Exchange contacts beyond Feeld if appropriate
- Be honest about your interest in continuing

**If you're not interested in more:**
- Be clear rather than ghosting
- "I had a great time—thanks for showing me [city]" is a complete message
- Don't promise to stay in touch if you won't

### Long-Distance Possibility

**If you both want to continue:**
- Be realistic about the challenges
- Discuss communication expectations
- Talk about when you might see each other again
- Consider whether long-distance actually works for you both

**Honest conversations:**
> "I really enjoyed our time together. I'd like to stay connected, but I want to be realistic—I don't know when I'll be back in [city]. What are your thoughts on how this could work?"

## Common Scenarios

### "I Don't Date Travelers"

Some people have this preference. Respect it:
- Don't try to convince them
- Don't take it personally
- It's a reasonable boundary
- Unmatch and move on

### "I've Been Burned by Travelers Before"

If someone is wary:
- Acknowledge their experience
- Demonstrate trustworthiness through actions
- Be extra clear about your intentions
- Don't pressure

**You might say:**
> "I understand that hesitation. I'm committed to being upfront about my situation and what I'm looking for. Happy to answer any questions that would help you feel comfortable."

### Running Out of Time

If your trip ends before you can meet someone:

**Options:**
- Acknowledge it honestly: "Looks like our schedules didn't align this trip. I'd love to connect next time I'm in town if you're still interested."
- Stay connected for future visits
- Accept that not every match works out

---

## Ethical Considerations

### Don't Pretend to Be Local

Pretending you live somewhere you don't:
- Is deceptive
- Wastes people's time
- Creates uncomfortable reveals
- Damages trust

Just be honest about being a visitor.

### Don't Treat Locals as Conquests

People aren't tourist attractions. They're people who:
- Have their own lives
- Deserve respect
- Aren't there for your entertainment
- Have heard "you're on my bucket list" before

Approach travel connections as genuine human interaction.

### Consider the Imbalance

As a traveler, you have freedom they might not:
- You leave; they stay
- You have novelty; they have routine
- You're on vacation mode; they're in regular life

Be aware of this dynamic and don't exploit it.

## FAQ

**Should I swipe before I arrive?**
Yes. Starting conversations in advance lets you plan dates that actually happen. Waiting until you land reduces your chances significantly.

**Is it okay to use Feeld just for travel hookups?**
If you're honest about it, yes. The ethics issue isn't the hookup—it's deception about what you're looking for.

**What if I live somewhere with no matches but travel a lot?**
Travel dating can become your primary dating strategy. Be upfront about your lifestyle and look for others who understand it.

**How do I handle time zones and communication after I leave?**
Discuss expectations before you go. Some connections naturally fade; others become long-distance. Clarity prevents confusion.
