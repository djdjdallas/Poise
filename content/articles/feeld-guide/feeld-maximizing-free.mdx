## Strategic Swiping

### Limited Likes = Be Selective

- Not during work/busy times

### Evaluate Profiles Carefully

**Before swiping right:**
- Read entire bio

## Conversation Excellence

- Full conversation capability
- Where connections actually happen
- Your main advantage

### Message Quality Matters

**Stand out by:**
- Personalized openers (reference their profile)
- Engaging follow-ups

- Good conversation skills
- Not generic messages

### Converting Matches

**Focus on:**
- Strong first messages
- Keeping conversations going

## Working with Limited Information

### Without "Who Liked You"

**You have to:**
- Swipe hoping for matches
- Be patient with the process
- Trust your profile works
- Not know before matching

### Making It Work

**Strategies:**
- Strong profile attracts likes you'll eventually match with
- Be patient—matches come
- Focus on what you can control
- Don't obsess about what you can't see

### Quality Signals

**You'll know things are working if:**
- Matches come regularly
- Conversations engage
- People respond well
- Results are happening

## Free Alternatives to Premium Features

### Can't See Who Liked You?

**Alternative:** Make a profile so good that you match with interested people anyway. The matches reveal the interest.

### Can't Filter by Desires?

**Alternative:** Read profiles carefully. Manual filtering takes time but works.

### Limited Likes?

**Alternative:** Be extremely selective. Quality likes beat quantity swipes.

### Can't Change Location?

**Alternative:** Focus on your actual location. Travel is great, but local dating works.

### No Incognito?

**Alternative:** Be comfortable with your visibility, or be selective about who you swipe.

## FAQ

**Can I really find matches on free Feeld?**
Yes. Many people do. Free Feeld has all core functionality. Premium adds convenience, not capability.

**Is free Feeld harder than premium?**
It requires more patience and strategy. You can't see who likes you or filter as precisely. But it works.

**Should I ever pay?**
