Feeld's Incognito Mode is one of the most requested premium features—and one of the most misunderstood. If you're considering upgrading to Majestic specifically for Incognito, you want to know exactly what you're getting.

This guide breaks down how Incognito Mode works, its limitations, and whether it's worth the subscription price for your situation.

## What Is Feeld Incognito Mode?

Incognito Mode is a privacy feature that makes your profile invisible to other users—unless you like them first.

**In normal mode:**
- Everyone who matches your criteria can see your profile
- You appear in their discover feed
- They can like you, ping you, or pass on you
- You have no control over who sees you

**In Incognito Mode:**
- Nobody can see your profile initially
- You browse completely invisibly
- When you like someone, only then do they see you
- People you don't like never know you exist

Think of it as browsing with a one-way mirror. You can see everyone; they can only see you if you choose to reveal yourself.

## How Incognito Mode Works

### Step 1: You Browse Invisibly
With Incognito enabled, you scroll through profiles like normal. But unlike normal mode, these people don't see your profile in their feed.

### Step 2: You Like Someone
When you find someone interesting, you like them (or ping them).

### Step 3: They Can Now See You
Your profile becomes visible to that specific person. They see you just like any other profile—they don't know you were in Incognito.

### Step 4: Match or Not
If they like you back, you match. If they don't, they move on—but at least you chose to reveal yourself to them.

### What They See
When you like someone from Incognito:
- They see your full profile
- They don't see an "Incognito user" label
- They can't tell you were browsing invisibly
- The experience is identical to a regular like

## Who Should Use Incognito Mode?

Incognito is valuable for specific situations. Consider it if you:

### Need Professional Discretion
Some jobs or industries make dating app visibility risky. If you're a teacher, therapist, public figure, or work in a conservative field, Incognito prevents accidental discovery by students, clients, or colleagues.

### Live in a Small Community
In areas where "everyone knows everyone," Incognito lets you explore without the whole town knowing. You control who learns you're on the app.

### Are Exploring ENM Privately
If you're in the early stages of exploring ethical non-monogamy—maybe before you've told certain people—Incognito lets you explore without premature exposure.

### Have Specific People to Avoid
Maybe you don't want your ex, roommate, or ex-coworker to find you. Incognito means they can't unless you choose to appear to them.

### Prefer to Control First Impressions
Some people like being the initiator. Incognito means you only appear to people you're already interested in, so every reveal is intentional.

### Are Anxious About Being "Out There"
Dating app visibility can feel exposing. Incognito reduces that anxiety by giving you complete control over who sees you.

---

## Who Doesn't Need Incognito Mode?

Incognito might not be worth it if you:

### Don't Mind Being Visible
If you're openly on Feeld and don't care who knows, Incognito removes a discovery channel. Some of your best matches might come from people who found you first.

### Want Maximum Exposure
Being visible means more people see your profile, which potentially means more matches. Incognito trades exposure for privacy.

### Are in a Large, Anonymous City
In major metros where you're unlikely to encounter anyone you know, Incognito's benefit is reduced.

### Are Already Open About ENM
If your friends, family, and coworkers already know about your relationship style, there's less to hide.

### Just Want to Save Money
Incognito requires Majestic subscription. If it's your only reason to upgrade, consider whether the other premium features justify the cost. See our [Feeld pricing breakdown](/feeld-guide/feeld-pricing).

## Incognito Mode Limitations

Important things Incognito doesn't do:

### You Still Appear to People You Like
Once you like someone, they see your full profile. Incognito isn't anonymity—it's selective visibility.

### It Doesn't Hide You from Existing Connections
People you've already matched with can still see and message you. Incognito only affects discovery.

### You Can't Receive First Moves
In Incognito, people can't like you first because they don't see you. If your strategy involves receiving interest rather than initiating, Incognito works against you.

### Pings Are Less Effective
If you like using pings to stand out, Incognito means the ping is their first impression of you—not a way to escalate existing visibility.

### It's Profile-Wide
You can't be Incognito to some people and visible to others (except through the like mechanism). It's all or nothing.

## Incognito Mode vs. Blocking

How do these compare for avoiding specific people?

| Feature | Incognito Mode | Blocking |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Cost | Majestic required | Free |
| Scope | Everyone | Specific people |
| Proactive | Yes | Requires seeing them first |
| Reversible | Toggle on/off | Unblock anytime |
| Best for | General privacy | Specific avoidance |

**If you only need to avoid a few specific people:** Blocking is free and effective.

**If you need broad privacy from anyone potentially recognizing you:** Incognito is the tool.

## How to Enable Incognito Mode

Incognito is a [Majestic (premium) feature](/feeld-guide/feeld-premium-worth-it). To use it:

### Step 1: Subscribe to Majestic
You need an active premium subscription.

### Step 2: Find the Setting
Go to your profile settings and look for Privacy or Incognito options.

### Step 3: Toggle It On
Enable Incognito Mode. Your profile immediately becomes invisible.

### Step 4: Browse Normally
Continue swiping and liking as usual. The only difference is you're invisible until you like someone.

### Step 5: Toggle Off Anytime
You can switch Incognito off whenever you want more visibility.

## Strategies for Using Incognito Effectively

### Be More Active
Since people can't find you, you need to find them. Incognito users should swipe more actively to maintain match flow.

### Like Generously
In normal mode, you might wait to see if someone likes you first. In Incognito, that never happens. Like everyone you're curious about.

### Use Pings Well
Since your first appearance is when you like them, a ping can make that first impression stronger. Consider pinging profiles you're especially interested in.

### Check Regularly
Because you're invisible, opportunities don't come to you. Daily app activity is more important in Incognito than in visible mode.

### Consider Toggling
You don't have to stay in Incognito permanently. Consider:
- Incognito on weekdays (when colleagues might browse)
- Visible on weekends (to maximize matches)
- Incognito when traveling (to explore without commitment)

## Is Incognito Worth Paying For?

**Yes, if:**
- Professional discretion is genuinely important
- You're exploring ENM privately
- You live somewhere small where visibility is risky
- Anxiety about being "seen" is blocking you from using the app
- You have disposable income for app subscriptions

**Probably not, if:**
- It's your only reason to upgrade
- You're already openly on dating apps
- You're in a large, anonymous metro
- You want to receive interest, not just initiate
- Budget is tight

**The honest answer:** Incognito is a nice-to-have privacy feature, but for most people, it's not essential. The more impactful Majestic feature is "See Who Liked You," which helps regardless of privacy concerns.

## Combining Incognito with Other Privacy Measures

For maximum privacy, combine Incognito with:

- **Unique photos** not used elsewhere online
- **Vague bio details** that don't identify you specifically
- **Non-Facebook login** (Apple ID, phone number)
- **Nickname** instead of your common name
- **Quick blocking** if you encounter someone to avoid

See our full [Feeld Facebook privacy guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-facebook-privacy) for more.

## Ready to Date on Your Terms?

Incognito gives you control over who sees you. But what you say in your profile and messages still determines whether those connections become something real. Poise helps you write authentically and connect effectively—on your terms.
