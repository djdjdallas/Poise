Solo polyamory has its own unique challenges on dating apps. You're not looking for a primary partner, you value your autonomy, and you need to communicate that clearly—while also finding people who actually understand and respect what solo poly means.

Feeld is one of the better apps for solo poly people, but it still requires some navigation. This guide covers how to set up your profile, handle common situations, and find connections that work for your relationship style.

## What Makes Solo Poly Different on Dating Apps

Solo poly people often encounter:

- **Assumptions you want to escalate** - People expecting you'll eventually want to "become" primary partners
- **Couple attention** - Being seen as an ideal "third" because you're unpartnered
- **Confusion about what you want** - People not understanding solo poly
- **Pressure to be more available** - Because you don't have a primary, people assume you have unlimited time

Feeld's ENM-aware user base helps, but you still need to communicate clearly.

## Setting Up Your Solo Poly Profile

### Desires to Select

**Recommended:**
- Polyamory
- Dating (if seeking romantic connections)
- Emotional connection
- Long-term (if you want ongoing relationships)
- Casual (if you're open to that too)

**Consider carefully:**
- Couples - Only if you're genuinely interested in dating couples
- Threesome - Only if that's something you want

### Bio Essentials

Your bio should communicate:

1. **That you're solo poly** - State it directly
2. **What that means to you** - Brief explanation helps
3. **What you're seeking** - Be specific
4. **What you're not seeking** - If relevant

**Example bio:**

> Solo poly and loving it. I have fulfilling connections and room for more—but I'm not looking for a primary partner or relationship escalator.
>
> Seeking: Ongoing connections with their own shape. Could be weekly dinners, monthly adventures, or something else entirely. Chemistry dependent.
>
> I'm a morning person pretending to be a night owl, currently obsessed with fermentation projects and long walks that turn into long talks.

## Handling Common Solo Poly Situations

### When Couples Approach You

As a solo poly person, you'll get attention from couples. Some want ethical connections; others see you as a convenient "unicorn."

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- Am I genuinely interested in both people?
- Are they treating me as a full person or an addition?
- Do they understand I'm not available to be their permanent third?
- Are the expectations clear and mutual?

**Red flags:**
- They only want you to date them together, never separately
- They expect you to be more available because you're "solo"
- They see you as filling a gap rather than being your own person
- One partner seems more into it than the other

### When People Don't Understand Solo Poly

Some matches won't get it. You'll hear:

- "So you're just afraid of commitment?"
- "You'll change your mind when you meet the right person"
- "That sounds lonely"

**How to respond:**
- Brief education if they seem genuinely curious
- Redirect to compatibility: "It sounds like we might want different things"
- Move on if they're dismissive—they're not your match

### When People Expect Escalation

Even people who say they understand poly might expect things to eventually "become more." Watch for:

- Hints about moving in together someday
- Assumptions about increasing time/priority
- Disappointment when you maintain boundaries
- Comments about wanting to be "more important"

**Be clear early:** "I love building deep connections, but I'm not looking to change my relationship structure. I'm happy being solo poly long-term."

## Finding Compatible Matches

### Look For

- People who have their own established lives
- Others who are solo poly (they exist on Feeld!)
- Partnered poly people with realistic expectations
- People who value quality time over quantity
- Those who respect autonomy in relationships

### Be Cautious Of

- People who seem to want a primary and are settling
- New-to-poly people who might want escalation later
- Anyone who sees your solo status as temporary
- Couples looking for a live-in third

### Good Questions to Ask

- "What does polyamory look like for you day-to-day?"
- "What are you hoping a new connection might look like?"
- "How do you feel about relationships that don't follow traditional escalation?"
- "What does an ideal ongoing connection look like for you?"

## Managing Multiple Connections

### Time and Energy

Solo poly doesn't mean unlimited availability. You still have:
- Your own life and interests
- Work and responsibilities
- Need for alone time
- Existing connections to maintain

Be realistic about your capacity. Having no primary doesn't mean having endless time.

### Communication

With multiple connections:
- Be clear about your availability
- Don't over-promise time you don't have
- Maintain your own calendar and boundaries
- Communicate changes proactively

### Avoiding Being the "Default Available" Person

Some partners might assume you're always free since you don't have a primary. Push back gently:

- "I have plans that night" (your plans can be solo plans)
- "My schedule is actually pretty full this week"
- "I prioritize alone time too—it's part of how I recharge"

## Solo Poly Profile Examples

### Example 1: Relationship-Focused Solo Poly

> Building a beautiful web of connections, each meaningful in its own way. Solo poly by choice—I love my autonomy and the depth that comes from intentional, non-escalator relationships.
>
> Looking for people who want real connection without a predetermined endpoint. Let's discover what we are together.
>
> Bookworm. Plant parent. Ambivalent about brunch but will always say yes to coffee.

### Example 2: More Casual Solo Poly

> Solo poly, happily entangled with a few wonderful people, room for more of the right connections.
>
> Not looking for a primary or to become anyone's primary. Looking for fun, chemistry, and connections that have their own rhythm.
>
> Tell me about something you're excited about lately.

### Example 3: Clear Boundaries Solo Poly

> Solo poly = I'm polyamorous and I don't have (or want) a primary/nesting partner. It's a feature, not a bug.
>
> Currently have two lovely ongoing connections. Looking for another person or two who gets that each relationship can be complete without being everything.
>
> Interests: rock climbing, terrible puns, cooking elaborate meals for people I like.

## Common Questions

### Should I mention I'm solo poly in the first message?

If it's not clear from your profile, yes. It's better to establish this early than have mismatched expectations later.

### How do I handle someone wanting more than I can give?

Kindly but clearly: "I really enjoy our connection. I want to be honest that this is the level of involvement I'm able to offer. If that doesn't work for you, I understand."

### Is solo poly the same as being single and dating around?

No. Solo poly is an intentional relationship structure. You can have deep, committed relationships—they just don't follow the traditional escalator toward cohabitation/marriage.

### Can solo poly people have "serious" relationships?

Absolutely. Solo poly relationships can be deep, long-term, and meaningful. "Serious" doesn't require hierarchy or escalation.
