## How Flags Interact

### Green Flags + Yellow Flags = Proceed with Caution

If someone shows good signs but also yellow flags:
- Don't dismiss them immediately
- Ask questions about the yellow areas
- See if green flags persist

### Red Flags + Green Flags = Red Wins

Even good qualities don't cancel red flags:
- Boundary violations matter regardless
- Dishonesty affects everything
- Don't rationalize red flags away

### Multiple Red Flags = Leave

One red flag might be a misunderstanding. Multiple means pattern:
- Trust the accumulation
- Don't try to fix them
- Unmatch and move on

## Trusting Your Instincts

### When Something Feels Off

- You don't need to identify the flag
- Discomfort is information
- You don't owe explanations

### When You Want to Give Benefit of Doubt

- Ask clarifying questions
- See how they respond to being questioned
- One chance is enough; patterns don't deserve more
