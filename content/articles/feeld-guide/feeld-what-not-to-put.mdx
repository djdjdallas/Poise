Some profile elements seem like good ideas but actually hurt your results. Before you write "I'm an open book, just ask!" or post that bathroom selfie, read this.

Here's what NOT to put in your Feeld profile.

---

## Photos to Avoid

### The Bathroom Selfie

**Why it's bad:**
- Poor lighting
- Unflattering environment
- Suggests low effort
- Toilet in background is not sexy

**Instead:** Get someone to take a photo of you, or use a timer in better lighting.

### Every Photo Is a Selfie

**Why it's bad:**
- One-dimensional view
- No context about your life
- Suggests you don't have anyone to take your photo
- Can look vain

**Instead:** Mix of selfies and photos others took of you.

### Heavily Filtered/FaceTuned Photos

**Why it's bad:**
- Doesn't look like you
- Sets up disappointment
- Suggests insecurity
- People want to know what you actually look like

**Instead:** Light editing is fine; distorting your features isn't.

### Old Photos

**Why it's bad:**
- Misleading about current appearance
- People feel catfished when they meet you
- Starts connection with dishonesty
- You look better now anyway (probably)

**Instead:** Photos from the last year, ideally last few months.

### Group Photos Where You're Unclear

**Why it's bad:**
- They don't know which one you are
- Makes them work too hard
- Confusing first impression
- Might think you're the wrong person

**Instead:** If using group photos, you should be obviously the subject, or label yourself.

### Photos With Exes Obviously Cropped

**Why it's bad:**
- Reminds people of your past relationships
- Looks low effort
- Residual arm around you is awkward
- Get new photos

**Instead:** Take fresh photos without having to crop someone out.

### Only Professional Photos

**Why it's bad:**
- Can seem fake or like a modeling portfolio
- People want to see real you
- Comes across as trying too hard
- No candid personality showing

**Instead:** Mix professional with casual, authentic shots.

### Photos of Just Your Body

**Why it's bad:**
- Suggests you're hiding your face
- Can seem like a catfish
- Only works if you have face photos too
- People want connection, not just bodies

**Instead:** If including body photos, also show your face clearly in other photos.

## Bio Red Flags

### "Just Ask"

**Why it's bad:**
- Puts all effort on them
- Gives nothing to work with
- Lazy
- Why should they ask when others give them something?

**Instead:** Give them something to ask about. Share actual information.

### "I'm Bad at Writing Bios"

**Why it's bad:**
- Self-deprecating in an unhelpful way
- Still tells them nothing
- Not charming, just low effort
- Many people say this

**Instead:** Just write something. Anything is better than meta-commentary about not writing.

### Long Lists of Requirements

**Why it's bad:**
- Comes across as demanding
- Focuses on negatives
- Makes you seem difficult
- People who meet requirements might still be turned off

**Instead:** State what you want positively, not as a checklist to pass.

### "Don't Message Me If..."

**Why it's bad:**
- Negativity is unattractive
- Focusing on what you don't want
- Creates hostile energy
- The people you're warning off won't read it anyway

**Instead:** Focus on what you DO want. "I'm looking for people who [positive trait]."

### Bitterness About Past Experiences

**Why it's bad:**
- Red flag for unprocessed issues
- Brings baggage into new connections
- Negativity is repellent
- Makes people worried you'll be difficult

**Instead:** Process your baggage elsewhere. Present your current, hopeful self.

### Inside Jokes No One Gets

**Why it's bad:**
- Alienates everyone who isn't in on it
- Seems like you're not really trying to connect
- Confusing
- Wasted space

**Instead:** Be accessible. Inside jokes are for after you've connected.

### Just Quotes or Lyrics

**Why it's bad:**
- Tells them nothing about YOU
- Many people use the same quotes
- Lazy
- Who are you behind the quote?

**Instead:** Use your own words. Or if using a quote, add context about why it matters to you.

### "Looking for the Jim to My Pam"

**Why it's bad:**
- Overused
- Assumes shared cultural references
- Generic
- Says nothing specific about what you want

**Instead:** Be specific about what you're actually looking for.

## Approach Mistakes

### Being Vague About What You Want

**Why it's bad:**
- Attracts everyone = attracts no one well
- Wastes time with mismatches
- Seems like you don't know yourself
- "Just seeing what's out there" is aimless

**Instead:** Be clear. "I'm looking for [specific type of connection]."

### Seeming Unavailable

**Why it's bad:**
- "Super busy, rarely on here" = why bother?
- Mixed signals about whether you want to connect
- People won't invest in someone who won't invest back
- If you're too busy to date, why are you on a dating app?

**Instead:** If you're on Feeld, be actually available for connections.

### Being Overly Sexual in Main Bio

**Why it's bad:**
- Feeld has desires for this
- Can seem one-dimensional
- Turns off people looking for connection
- Attracts people only interested in one thing

**Instead:** Save explicit content for desires or later conversation. Bio should show you're a full person.

### Bragging or Showing Off

**Why it's bad:**
- Comes across as insecure
- Not humble
- "I own a [fancy car/house/job]" = trying to buy attraction
- Confidence is attractive; arrogance isn't

**Instead:** Let your qualities show naturally without explicit bragging.

### Self-Deprecation Overload

**Why it's bad:**
- Drains confidence energy
- They might believe you
- Humor is fine; genuine putting yourself down isn't
- "You probably won't be interested, but..." = self-fulfilling prophecy

**Instead:** Present yourself positively. You have value; show it.

## Desire Mistakes

### Selecting Everything

**Why it's bad:**
- Means nothing
- Seems desperate or undiscerning
- Dilutes compatibility signals
- You're probably not actually into everything

**Instead:** Select only things you genuinely want.

### Selecting Nothing

**Why it's bad:**
- Wastes the feature
- Gives no compatibility information
- Seems like you didn't bother
- Missed conversation starters

**Instead:** Take time to select relevant desires.

### Misleading Desires

**Why it's bad:**
- Attracts people you're not compatible with
- Wastes everyone's time
- Starts connection with mismatch
- They'll find out eventually

**Instead:** Be honest about what you're actually into.

---

## General Mistakes

### All Negatives, No Positives

**Why it's bad:**
- Creates pessimistic impression
- Seems like you're not excited about dating
- Repels positive energy
- Attracts people who bond over complaints

**Instead:** Lead with what you want, enjoy, and offer.

### Too Much, Too Soon

**Why it's bad:**
- Overwhelming
- Save some for conversation
- Wall of text is hard to read
- Leave some mystery

**Instead:** Be substantive but concise. They can learn more in conversation.

### Nothing at All

**Why it's bad:**
- Zero reason to swipe right
- Seems like you're not serious
- Nothing to message about
- Why would they invest if you won't?

**Instead:** Fill out your profile. It matters.

## The Test

### Before Posting, Ask

**For photos:**
- Would I be happy if this is how they picture me?
- Does this represent who I am now?
- Would I swipe right on this person?

**For bio:**
- Would I message this person?
- Does this sound like me?
- Is there something to respond to?

**For desires:**
- Are these actually what I want?
- Do they give useful compatibility information?
- Would I be happy matching with someone who has these same desires?

---

## FAQ

**Is any of this actually that important?**
Yes. First impressions matter on dating apps. People make decisions in seconds.

**What if I think these "mistakes" are authentic to me?**
Some authenticity is worth showing; some is better shared after you've connected. Strategic presentation isn't being fake.

**Won't the right person like me anyway?**
They can't like you if they don't swipe. Get the right people's attention first.
