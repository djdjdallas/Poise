Most people spend time choosing which photos to use but ignore the order. Photo sequence matters—a lot. The right order can dramatically increase your matches.

Here's how to sequence your Feeld photos strategically.

---

## Why Order Matters

### The First Photo Effect

**Your first photo:**
- Determines whether people look further
- Appears in search results
- Is what people remember
- Makes the first impression

**If it doesn't hook them, they never see the rest.**

### The Narrative Arc

**Photo order tells a story:**
- First impression
- Who you are
- What you're about
- Lasting impression

**You control this story through sequence.**

### People Judge Quickly

**Swiping behavior:**
- Many people decide on first 1-2 photos
- Some look at all photos
- Order affects both groups
- First and last stick in memory

---

## The Ideal Sequence

### Position 1: The Hook

**Your first photo should be:**
- Your best overall photo
- Clear face, good lighting
- Most attractive (while accurate)
- Inviting expression
- What makes someone want to see more

**This is not necessarily:**
- Your sexiest photo
- Your most artistic photo
- Your most interesting photo
- A photo that requires context

### Position 2: The Confirmation

**Second photo should:**
- Confirm the first impression
- Show you from different angle
- Full body or different context
- Prove photo 1 wasn't a fluke
- Build on initial attraction

### Position 3-4: The Story

**Middle photos should:**
- Show personality and interests
- Provide variety
- Give conversation starters
- Round out who you are
- Show different aspects

### Last Position: The Closer

**Final photo should:**
- Leave strong impression
- Not be your weakest photo
- Memorable or interesting
- Something that sticks
- Reinforce why they should swipe right

## What Goes Where

### Best for Position 1

### Best for Position 2

- Confirms attractiveness
- Shows more of you

- Conversation starters

### Best for Last Position

**Good closing photos:**

## Common Ordering Mistakes

### Best Photo Not First

**Problem:**
- Starting with good-not-great photo
- Saving best for later
- People never see it

**Fix:**
- Lead with your strongest
- Don't save the best for last
- First impression is everything

### Worst Photo Last

**Problem:**
- Ending on weak note
- Last thing they see is poorest photo
- Leaves wrong impression

**Fix:**
- Put weakest photos in middle
- End strong
- If a photo is weak enough to hurt, remove it

### No Variety in Order

**Problem:**
- All similar photos in a row
- No visual interest
- Redundant sequence

**Fix:**
- Alternate types
- Face → body → activity → face
- Keep it visually interesting

### Group Photo First

**Problem:**
- Don't know who you are
- Confusing
- Loses people immediately

**Fix:**
- Never start with group photos
- If using group photo, put late in order
- Always start with clear solo shot

## FAQ

**How do I know if my order is working?**
Track your matches. Try different orders for a week each. Compare results. Let data guide you.

**Should I start with my sexiest photo?**
Not necessarily. Start with your most attractive that's also approachable. "Sexy" can feel try-hard as first image.

**Does the order really matter that much?**
Yes. The same photos in different orders can produce very different results. First photo especially matters.

**How often should I change the order?**
When results stall, when you add new photos, or when testing. Every few weeks to month is reasonable.
