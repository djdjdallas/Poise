Not every match deserves hours of conversation. A quick vetting process helps you identify promising connections and filter out mismatches early.

Here's a 5-minute system for evaluating Feeld matches.

## Why Vetting Matters

### The Problem

Without vetting:
- Hours spent on incompatible matches
- Emotional investment before knowing basics
- Missing obvious red flags
- Dating fatigue accelerates

### The Solution

A quick system that checks:
- Authenticity (are they real?)
- Compatibility (do you actually match?)
- Availability (are they actually looking?)
- Safety (any red flags?)

## The 5-Minute Vetting System

### Minute 1: Profile Authenticity

**Photo check:**

**Bio check:**

- [ ] Sounds like a real person

**Red flags:**

### Minute 2: Compatibility Scan

**Desires match:**

**Values indicators:**

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- Would I enjoy a conversation with this person?
- Do they seem like someone I'd actually connect with?
- Is what they're offering what I'm seeking?

### Minute 3: Opening Message Analysis

**Good signs:**

- Respectful tone

**Warning signs:**

**Red flags:**
- Ignores what you said
- Immediately sexual
- Pushes to move off platform
- Vague or generic answers

### Minute 5: Gut Check

**Ask yourself:**
- Am I genuinely interested or just responding?
- Do I feel respected in this exchange?
- Would I want to meet this person?
- Is there anything making me uncomfortable?

**Trust your instincts:**
- If something feels off, it probably is
- You don't owe anyone continued conversation
- It's okay to unmatch without explanation

## Deeper Vetting (When Interested)

After initial check, before meeting:

### Information to Gather

**Basic facts:**
- First name
- General location
- How long on Feeld
- What they're looking for

**ENM specifics:**
- Relationship structure
- Partner awareness/involvement
- Experience level
- Current availability

**Lifestyle basics:**
- General schedule availability
- Any relevant life circumstances
- Communication preferences

### Questions That Reveal Character

**About ENM:**
> "What does ethical non-monogamy mean to you?"
> "What's your relationship setup like?"

**About communication:**
> "What works well for you in terms of texting frequency?"
> "How do you prefer to handle scheduling?"

**About what they want:**
> "What's a great connection look like for you?"
> "What are you hoping to find on Feeld?"

### Video Call Vetting

Before meeting in person:
> "I'd love to do a quick video chat before we meet. Are you free for 15 minutes sometime this week?"

**During the call:**
- Do they match their photos?
- Does conversation flow naturally?
- Do you feel comfortable?
- Any red flags in how they communicate?

## Common Vetting Scenarios

### The Fast-Mover

**Signs:**
- Wants to meet immediately
- Pushes for personal info quickly
- Seems impatient with normal getting-to-know

**How to handle:**
> "I prefer to chat a bit before meeting. If that doesn't work for you, we might not be a good match."

### The Slow Responder

**Consider:**
- They might be busy
- ENM people often have full lives
- Slow doesn't mean uninterested

**Test:**
- Give reasonable time
- If weeks pass with nothing, move on
- Their pace tells you about availability

### The Couple Match

**Additional vetting:**
- Both people involved in conversation?
- How do they make decisions?
- What's each person looking for?
- Any signs of unicorn hunting?

### The New User

**Adjust expectations:**
- Fewer photos might be privacy, not fakeness
- May not know platform norms
- Could be great connection, just new

**Extra verification:**
- Video call more important
- Ask more about their ENM experience
- Watch for learning curve vs. red flags
