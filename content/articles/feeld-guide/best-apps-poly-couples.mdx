Finding a third as a poly couple comes with unique challenges. Most dating apps aren't designed for couple dating, and the ones that are have their own quirks.

This guide compares the best options for poly couples seeking ethical connections—whether you're looking for ongoing relationships, casual encounters, or something in between.

## The Couple Dating Challenge

Before comparing apps, let's acknowledge the reality:

**Why it's hard:**
- Many singles aren't interested in couples
- "Unicorn hunting" has given couples a bad reputation
- Most apps don't support couple profiles well
- The dating pool for couples is inherently smaller

**What makes it work:**
- Being genuinely ethical (not just claiming to be)
- Treating potential thirds as full humans, not accessories
- Using apps designed for this use case
- Clear communication about what you're offering

For more on ethical approaches, see our [ethical couples guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-for-couples).

### Feeld Pros for Couples

3. **Be specific about what you're seeking** - Use Desires accurately

## Red Flags and Ethics

Whatever app you use, being ethical matters:

### Don't

- Create misleading profiles
- Hide that you're a couple until later
- Treat potential thirds as objects
- Ghost people after meeting
- Pressure anyone into anything

### Do

- Be completely transparent
- Respect that thirds have their own lives and needs
- Communicate clearly about what you're offering
- Treat people as potential partners, not accessories
- Accept rejection gracefully

For more on ethical approaches, see our guide on [avoiding unicorn hunting](/feeld-guide/feeld-for-couples).

## Making Your Profile Work

Whichever app you choose, your profile determines your success:

### Both Partners Need Quality Profiles

- Clear individual photos
- At least one couple photo
- Bios that show personality beyond "we're a couple"
- Clear statement of what you're looking for

### Be Specific About Your Situation

What potential thirds want to know:
- What's your relationship dynamic?
- What are you looking for? (Casual, ongoing, specific activities?)
- How do you date? (Together only? Sometimes separately?)
- What do you offer as partners?

## The Best App Is the One You Use Well

Any of these apps can work for the right couple. The difference isn't just which app you choose—it's how you present yourselves and communicate with potential matches.

Poise helps couples write profiles that attract compatible thirds and craft messages that start genuine conversations. Because finding a third is hard enough without also struggling with what to say.
