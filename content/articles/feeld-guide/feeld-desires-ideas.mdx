Staring at Feeld's Desires list and not sure what to select? You're not alone. The options can feel overwhelming, and choosing wrong might attract the wrong people.

This guide gives you concrete ideas for what Desires to put on your profile based on what you're actually looking for. Copy these combinations or use them as starting points.

## How to Think About Desires

Before selecting, ask yourself:

1. **What kind of relationship am I seeking?** (Casual, dating, serious?)
2. **What's my relationship structure?** (Single, partnered, poly?)
3. **What connection style do I prefer?** (Emotional, physical, intellectual?)
4. **Are there specific activities I'm interested in?** (Kink, threesomes, etc.)

Your answers guide your selections.

## Desires Ideas by Dating Goal

### I Want Something Casual

**Select:**
- Casual
- Physical connection
- Spontaneous
- Open relationship (if applicable)
- New experiences

**Why it works:** These signal you're not looking for commitment without being cold. "Spontaneous" adds personality.

**Consider adding:** One interest-based Desire to show you're a person, not just looking to hook up

### I Want to Date (But Not Rush)

**Select:**
- Dating
- Emotional connection
- Slow burn
- Intellectual connection
- Open relationship or Polyamory (if applicable)

**Why it works:** Signals you want real connection but aren't desperate to lock something down immediately.

### I Want a Serious Relationship

**Select:**
- Dating
- Long-term
- Emotional connection
- Intellectual connection
- Polyamory or Monogamy (depending on your style)

**Why it works:** Clear about wanting something meaningful and lasting.

### I Want Friends With Benefits

**Select:**
- Friendship
- Casual
- Physical connection
- Emotional connection

**Why it works:** The combination of Friendship + Physical signals FWB. Adding Emotional connection shows you want genuine friendship, not just bodies.

## Desires Ideas by Relationship Style

### I'm Single and Monogamy-Oriented

**Select:**
- Monogamy
- Dating
- Long-term (if applicable)
- Emotional connection
- Intellectual connection

**Note:** Feeld's user base skews ENM, but monogamous people do use it. Be aware you're in a smaller pool.

### I'm Single and ENM-Curious

**Select:**
- Open relationship
- New experiences
- Dating
- Emotional connection

**Why it works:** "Open relationship" is broader than "Polyamory" for those still exploring. "New experiences" signals openness.

### I'm Single and Poly

**Select:**
- Polyamory
- Dating
- Emotional connection
- Long-term (if you have capacity)
- Whatever specific interests apply

For more detail, see our [ENM Desires guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-enm-desires).

### I'm Partnered/Married and ENM

**Select:**
- Open relationship or Polyamory
- Dating or Casual (depending on what you're seeking)
- Emotional connection (if seeking depth)
- Physical connection (if seeking fun)

**Make clear in bio:** Your relationship status and what you're looking for

### I'm Part of a Couple Looking Together

**Select:**
- Singles (if seeking individuals)
- Couples (if seeking other couples)
- Threesome (if applicable)
- Open relationship
- Whatever dynamic Desires apply

See our [Feeld for couples guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-for-couples).

## Desires Ideas by Interest

### I'm Interested in Kink

**Select:**
- Kink (the broad category)
- BDSM (if relevant)
- Your specific dynamic: Dominant, Submissive, or Switch
- Shibari (if specifically interested in rope)

**Best practice:** Don't select every kink-related Desire. Pick the ones that are actually important to you.

### I'm Interested in Group Experiences

**Select:**
- Threesome
- Group play (if more than three)
- Couples or Singles (depending on what you're seeking)
- New experiences
- Sex positive

### I'm Interested in Watching/Being Watched

**Select:**
- Watching (voyeurism)
- Being watched (exhibitionism)
- Whatever other relevant Desires

### I'm Vanilla but Open-Minded

**Select:**
- New experiences
- Sex positive
- Emotional connection
- Physical connection

**Why it works:** Shows you're not closed off without claiming expertise in things you haven't tried.

## Desires to Avoid Combining

Some combinations send mixed signals:

### Contradictory Combinations

**Problematic:**
- Monogamy + Threesome + Couples

This confuses people. Are you monogamous or not?

**Problematic:**
- Long-term + Casual only

What are you actually looking for?

### Overloaded Combinations

**Too much:**
- Every kink Desire selected
- Every relationship style selected
- 15+ Desires total

This signals you're not clear on what you want—or that you're just checking boxes.

---

## How Many Desires Should You Select?

**Minimum:** 4-5 (gives enough signal)

**Ideal:** 6-10 (shows depth without overload)

**Maximum:** 12-15 (beyond this, it's noise)

Quality over quantity. Every Desire should actually apply to you.

---

## Desires You Might Be Forgetting

### "Intellectual Connection"
Often overlooked but attracts thoughtful people who value good conversation.

### "Slow Burn"
Useful if you don't want to rush. Filters out people looking for immediate hookups.

### "Sex Positive"
Signals you're comfortable discussing sexuality openly—important for Feeld's vibe.

### "Friendship"
Many great connections start as or include friendship. Don't ignore this option.

---

## Testing Your Desires

### After Setting Up:
Give it a week of regular app use. Are you:
- Getting matches?
- Attracting compatible people?
- Having your Desires referenced in conversations?

### If Not Working:
Adjust 2-3 Desires at a time and observe changes. Too many changes at once makes it hard to know what helped.

### Ask Yourself:
"If someone only saw my Desires, what would they think I want?" Make sure that matches reality.

## Your Desires + Everything Else

Desires are powerful but not the whole picture. Your [photos](/feeld-guide/feeld-photo-guide), [bio](/feeld-guide/feeld-bio-examples), and Interests all work together to attract compatible matches.

And once you match, what you say matters most. Poise helps you write opening messages that reference shared Desires naturally and turn compatibility signals into real conversations.
