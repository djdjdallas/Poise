Need to cancel your Feeld Majestic subscription? Whether you found someone, are taking a break, or just realized premium isn't for you, this guide walks you through exactly how to cancel—plus how to request a refund if you're eligible.

The process depends on how you originally subscribed, so we'll cover all platforms.

## Important: Where Did You Subscribe?

This matters because you cancel through whoever processed your payment—not necessarily through Feeld directly.

**If you subscribed:**
- **Through App Store (iPhone)** → Cancel via Apple
- **Through Google Play (Android)** → Cancel via Google
- **Through Feeld website** → Cancel via Feeld

If you're not sure, check your email for the subscription confirmation or look at your purchase history.

## When Refunds Are Most Likely

Refunds are more likely if:

- You just subscribed (within 24-48 hours)
- You haven't used premium features
- There's a technical problem
- You were double-charged
- The purchase was unauthorized

Refunds are less likely if:

- Significant time has passed
- You've actively used the features
- You're simply not satisfied with results
- You've requested refunds before

## Cancel vs. Delete: What's the Difference?

**Canceling subscription:**
- Stops future payments
- Keeps your account and data
- Reverts to free features
- Matches and messages preserved

**Deleting account:**
- Removes your entire profile
- Erases matches and conversations
- Cannot be undone
- You'd need to start fresh

If you're taking a break but might return, cancel your subscription but keep your account. Deleting is permanent.

## How to Pause Instead of Cancel

If you're not sure about canceling, consider:

### Option 1: Just Stop Paying
Cancel subscription but keep your free account. You can still match, just without premium features.

### Option 2: Hide Your Profile
Some apps let you hide/pause your profile while keeping your subscription. Check Feeld's current settings for this option.

### Option 3: Delete and Return Later
If you want a complete break, you can delete your account and create a new one later. Note: you lose all matches and conversations.

## After Canceling: What You Lose

When Majestic expires, you lose:

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| See who liked you | Lost |
| Advanced filters | Lost |
| Incognito Mode | Lost |
| Extra pings | Lost |
| Unlimited rewinds | Lost |
| Activity status | Lost |
| Basic matching | Kept |
| Messaging matches | Kept |
| Your profile | Kept |

You don't lose your profile, matches, or conversations. Just the premium features.

## Avoiding Unwanted Renewals

To prevent surprise charges:

### Turn Off Auto-Renew Immediately
When you subscribe, immediately go to your subscription settings and turn off auto-renewal. You keep your current period but won't be charged again.

### Set Calendar Reminders
Mark your calendar 2-3 days before renewal date. Decide then if you want to continue.

### Use Short Subscriptions First
When trying a new app, start with 1-month subscriptions despite the higher per-month cost. Evaluate before committing to longer terms.

### Check Statements Monthly
Review your credit card or bank statements for recurring charges you forgot about.

---

## Subscription Questions

### Can I get a partial refund for unused time?
Generally no. Subscriptions are for set periods. If you cancel mid-month, you typically don't get a prorated refund.

### What if I subscribed through a different device?
Subscriptions are tied to your payment platform (Apple/Google), not your device. Cancel through whichever account you used to subscribe.

### Will canceling affect my matches?
No. Your existing matches and conversations remain. You just lose premium features.

### Can I resubscribe later?
Yes. You can subscribe again anytime through your preferred platform.

### What if I was charged incorrectly?
Contact both Feeld support and your payment platform (Apple/Google). Incorrect charges are usually resolved quickly.

## Decided Premium Isn't Worth It?

If you're canceling because Feeld Majestic didn't improve your results, the issue might not be features—it might be your profile or messaging approach.

Poise helps you write profiles that attract compatible matches and craft openers that get responses. Whether you're on free or premium Feeld, better communication gets better results.
