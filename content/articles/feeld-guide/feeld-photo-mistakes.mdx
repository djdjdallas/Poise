## FAQ

**How do I know if my photos are the problem?**
If you're getting few matches but good conversations once matched, photos might be fine. If you're getting matches but bad responses, bio might be the issue. If nothing works, start with photos.

**Should I get professional photos taken?**
It can help, but make sure they look natural, not like headshots. The goal is high quality candids, not corporate portraits.

**Is one bad photo hurting my whole profile?**
Yes, potentially. People often judge by worst photo. Remove anything that doesn't serve you.

**How often should I update photos?**
Every 6-12 months, or whenever your appearance changes significantly. Fresh photos can also reset your profile in the algorithm.
