## Strategic Desire Selection

### The Goldilocks Zone

**Not too few:**
- Seems like you haven't filled out your profile
- Less to match on
- Less to talk about
- Limits compatibility signals

**Not too many:**
- Seems unfocused
- Everything is "equal" so nothing stands out
- Might seem like you're into everything
- Dilutes what you actually want

**Just right:**
- 10-20 carefully chosen desires
- Represents what you're actually interested in
- Focuses on what matters most
- Gives conversation hooks without overwhelming

### Quality Over Quantity

**Better approach:**
- Only select things you're genuinely interested in
- Don't add things just to seem more appealing
- Curate for compatibility, not completeness
- Be honest about your actual interests

## Categories of Desires

### Relationship Structure Desires

**Examples:**
- Polyamory
- Open relationship
- Casual dating
- Long-term connection

**Strategy:** Select what you're actually looking for. These are primary filters for compatibility.

### Dynamic Desires

**Examples:**
- Dominant
- Submissive
- Switch
- Vanilla

**Strategy:** Be honest about your interests and experience level. Mismatches here cause problems.

### Activity Desires

**Examples:**
- Specific kinks
- Sexual interests
- Types of play
- Preferences

**Strategy:** Select what you're genuinely into, not aspirational or performative interests.

### Lifestyle Desires

**Examples:**
- 420 friendly
- Travel
- Foodie
- Certain interests

**Strategy:** Use to signal compatibility beyond the sexual/romantic.

## What Your Desires Communicate

### First Impressions

**People make assumptions:**
- Many desires = experienced or exploratory
- Few desires = selective or new
- Specific desires = knows what they want
- Broad desires = flexible or unfocused

### Compatibility Signals

**Shared desires suggest:**
- Common interests
- Potential conversation topics
- Baseline compatibility
- Starting points for connection

### Red Flags (To Avoid Communicating)

**Watch out for:**
- Only sexual desires (seems one-dimensional)
- Contradictory desires (confusing)
- Everything selected (means nothing)
- Nothing selected (why are you here?)

## Updating Your Desires

### When to Update

**Consider changing when:**
- You're not getting matches you want
- Your interests have changed
- You're seeking something different
- Your current selection isn't working

### How to Test

**Experiment:**
- Make changes
- Track results over a week
- Compare to previous experience
- Iterate based on data

### Seasonal Updates

**Periodically review:**
- Are these still accurate?
- Have my interests evolved?
- Am I getting the right matches?
- What would I change?

---

## Desires and Privacy

### What You're Comfortable Sharing

**Consider:**
- Desires are public to matches
- Anyone who sees your profile sees them
- Some interests you might want to discuss privately
- Balance openness with privacy

### Sensitive Desires

**For sensitive interests:**
- May or may not want on public profile
- Can discuss in conversation instead
- Consider who sees your profile
- Privacy settings may affect visibility

## Desires as Conversation Starters

### Reference in Messages

**Use desires to connect:**
> "I noticed we both have [desire] listed—what's drawn you to that?"

### Ask About Theirs

**Show interest:**
> "I'm curious about your interest in [desire]. Tell me more?"

### Find Common Ground

**Highlight matches:**
> "We seem to have a lot of overlap in what we're looking for. What matters most to you?"

## FAQ

**How many desires should I have?**
Aim for 10-20 genuinely relevant ones. Enough to show who you are, not so many it's meaningless.

**Should I select desires I'm curious about but haven't tried?**
It depends. If you're open to exploring, sure. If it would be misleading, leave it off.

**Do desires actually affect who I see?**
Yes, they influence Feeld's matching. Shared desires indicate compatibility.

**What if my desires change over time?**
Update your profile. Your desires should represent your current interests.
