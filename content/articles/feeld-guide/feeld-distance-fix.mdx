You set your Feeld distance to 25 miles, yet you're seeing profiles from three states away. Or maybe the opposite—people nearby aren't showing up at all. Feeld's distance settings can be frustrating when they don't work as expected.

This guide covers why distance settings misbehave on Feeld and how to actually fix them.

## How Feeld Distance Settings Work

Before troubleshooting, it helps to understand what Feeld's distance settings actually control.

**What your distance setting does:**
- Sets the maximum distance for profiles shown to you
- Filters your discover feed based on location
- Does NOT prevent you from appearing to users outside your range

**What it doesn't do:**
- Hide you from people with wider distance settings
- Guarantee everyone you see is within range
- Update instantly when you change locations

This is an important distinction. If someone 100 miles away has their distance set to 150 miles, they can still see you—even if your setting is 25 miles.

## Common Distance Problems and Fixes

### Problem 1: Seeing People Way Too Far Away

**Why it happens:**
- Travel Mode: The other person may be using travel mode, which shows them in your area even though they're physically elsewhere
- Recent location: Feeld uses last known location, not real-time GPS. If someone was in your city last week, they might still appear
- Cached location: Your own location may not have updated properly

**Fixes:**
1. **Check for travel mode indicators** - Feeld sometimes shows when someone is using travel mode
2. **Refresh your location** - Open Feeld, go to settings, and trigger a location refresh (see steps below)
3. **Restart the app** - Close completely and reopen to force a location update
4. **Check your own settings** - Make sure you haven't accidentally enabled travel mode yourself

### Problem 2: Your Location Is Completely Wrong

**Why it happens:**
- You denied location permissions initially
- VPN or privacy software is masking your location
- The app is using a stale cached location
- You traveled recently and it hasn't updated

**Fixes:**

**On iPhone:**
1. Go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services
2. Find Feeld and set to "While Using the App"
3. Open Feeld and let it refresh
4. Alternatively, set to "Always" temporarily, then back to "While Using"

**On Android:**
1. Go to Settings > Apps > Feeld > Permissions
2. Enable Location (select "Allow only while using the app")
3. Make sure "Use precise location" is enabled
4. Open Feeld and wait for location update

**Force refresh location:**
1. Open Feeld
2. Go to your profile settings
3. Look for location or distance settings
4. Toggle your distance to a different value, then back
5. Close and reopen the app

### Problem 3: Not Seeing Nearby People

**Why it happens:**
- Low user density in your area
- Your filters are too restrictive
- The nearby people have narrow distance settings themselves
- They may have paused or hidden their profiles

**Fixes:**
1. **Widen your distance** - Try setting to maximum temporarily to see if more profiles appear
2. **Check other filters** - Age range, gender preferences, and desire filters all reduce your pool
3. **Accept the reality** - In some areas, there simply aren't many Feeld users

### Problem 4: Distance Changes After Traveling

**Why it happens:**
- Feeld detected your travel and updated location
- You may have accidentally enabled travel mode
- VPN on your phone changed apparent location

**Fixes:**
1. **Check travel mode** - Make sure it's turned off if you're home
2. **Force location refresh** - Use the steps above
3. **Disable VPN** - Location services can be affected by VPNs

## Step-by-Step: Resetting Your Feeld Location

If nothing else is working, try a complete location reset:

### Step 1: Check Permissions
- iPhone: Settings > Feeld > Location > "While Using"
- Android: Settings > Apps > Feeld > Permissions > Location enabled

### Step 2: Disable VPN
If you use a VPN, turn it off temporarily while using Feeld.

### Step 3: Force Close Feeld
- iPhone: Swipe up from bottom, swipe Feeld away
- Android: Settings > Apps > Feeld > Force Stop

### Step 4: Refresh GPS
Open Apple Maps or Google Maps and let it find your location. This wakes up your phone's GPS.

### Step 5: Reopen Feeld
Launch Feeld and let it load completely. Your location should update.

### Step 6: Verify in Settings
Check your profile settings to confirm the location looks correct.

## Travel Mode: Using Distance to Your Advantage

Feeld offers a travel mode feature (available to Majestic subscribers) that lets you appear in a different location. This is useful for:

- Planning ahead before a trip
- Connecting with people in a city you're visiting
- Exploring what other areas' dating pools look like

**How to use travel mode:**
1. Open Feeld settings
2. Look for "Travel Mode" or "Location" settings
3. Set your destination city
4. Your profile appears there instead of your actual location

**Note:** This is a Majestic (premium) feature. Free users can only appear in their actual location. For more on premium features, see our [Feeld pricing guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-pricing).

## Why People Far Away Still See You

Even with tight distance settings, you'll occasionally get likes or pings from people far away. Here's why:

**They're using travel mode** - Exploring your city remotely

**They have wide settings** - Their distance is set to 500+ miles

**They're actually nearby** - Visiting or recently moved

**They were nearby** - Location hasn't updated since they left

**Algorithm quirks** - Feeld occasionally shows profiles outside stated preferences

You can't prevent this entirely. It's just how the app works.

## Distance Settings for Different Goals

Your ideal distance setting depends on what you're looking for:

### Casual/Hookups
- Keep distance moderate (25-50 miles)
- People won't travel far for casual connections
- Focus on realistic meetup distances

### Dating/Relationships
- Can go wider (50-100+ miles)
- Quality connections are worth some travel
- Especially in lower-density areas

### Couples Looking for Thirds
- Often need wider settings
- The pool for couples is smaller
- Quality matches may require more distance flexibility

### In Major Cities
- Can often stay tight (10-25 miles)
- Enough users to be selective
- Traffic/logistics matter for actual dates

### In Smaller Areas
- Go wide (100+ miles)
- Accept that your pool is limited
- Quality over proximity

## When Distance Settings Legitimately Don't Matter

Sometimes distance issues are actually non-issues:

**Long-distance can work** - For the right connection, people travel. Don't automatically skip someone 100 miles away if they're interesting.

**Travel happens** - You might meet someone visiting your city. They go home, but you can visit each other.

**Relocation happens** - People move. A match 200 miles away might be relocating to your city next month.

**ENM often involves distance** - If you're polyamorous or ENM, partners often live in different places. It's normal.

Don't let distance settings become an excuse to skip potentially great connections.
