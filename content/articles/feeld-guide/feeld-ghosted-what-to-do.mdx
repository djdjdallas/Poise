You were having a great conversation. Maybe you'd even made plans. Then suddenly—nothing. No response, no explanation, just silence.

Welcome to getting ghosted on Feeld. It happens to everyone, and it never feels great.

Here's how to handle it.

## Why People Ghost on Feeld

Understanding the "why" doesn't fix the sting, but it helps you not take it personally.

### They Got Overwhelmed

Feeld users—especially women and attractive profiles—get a lot of messages. Sometimes people simply can't keep up and let conversations slip.

**This isn't about you**: It's about bandwidth.

### Life Happened

People get busy, stressed, distracted. They meant to respond and then... didn't. Days passed. Now it feels weird to reply.

**This isn't about you**: It's about their life.

### They Met Someone

Feeld users often date multiple people. Sometimes someone else becomes the focus and other conversations fade.

**This isn't about you**: It's about timing.

### Their Partner Had Concerns

For coupled users, a partner's discomfort can suddenly shut things down without explanation.

**This isn't about you**: It's about their relationship dynamics.

### They Lost Interest

Sometimes the connection that seemed good wasn't as strong for them. Rather than have an awkward conversation, they disappeared.

**This might be about fit**: But not your worth.

### They Were Never Serious

Some people use dating apps for validation, boredom, or entertainment without intending to actually meet anyone.

**This isn't about you**: It's about them.

## The Stages of Getting Ghosted

### 1. Confusion
"Did I say something wrong? Maybe they're just busy?"

### 2. Hope
"They'll probably respond later. People get busy."

### 3. Checking
Opening the app repeatedly. Looking at their activity. Analyzing your last message.

### 4. Disappointment
Realizing they're probably not going to respond.

### 5. Moving On
Accepting it and refocusing your energy.

The goal is to move through these stages quickly rather than getting stuck in stages 2-4.

## What To Do When You Get Ghosted

### Wait (Briefly)

Give it 48-72 hours before concluding you've been ghosted. People do get busy. Life does interfere.

### Send One Follow-Up (Optional)

A single, low-key follow-up is acceptable:

> "Hey! Hope your week's going well. Did life get crazy, or should I take the hint? Either way, no hard feelings."

> "Hey, just checking in—hope everything's okay on your end."

**Do NOT:**
- Send multiple messages
- Demand an explanation
- Express frustration or hurt
- Try to guilt them into responding

If they don't respond to one follow-up, that's your answer.

### Accept the Non-Response as a Response

Silence is communication. It says: "I'm not interested enough to continue this."

It's not the communication you deserved, but it's the one you got. Accept it and move forward.

### Delete and Move On

Once you've accepted it:
- Unmatch or hide the conversation
- Stop checking their profile
- Redirect your energy elsewhere

Keeping the conversation visible keeps the hope alive unnecessarily.

---

## What NOT to Do

### Don't Take It Personally

Ghosting says very little about you and a lot about them. People ghost when they:
- Don't know how to communicate
- Avoid discomfort
- Have their own issues

Your worth isn't determined by whether a stranger responded to messages.

### Don't Send Angry Messages

Tempting? Yes. Satisfying? Momentarily. Worth it? Never.

**Don't send:**
> "Wow, thanks for wasting my time."
> "You could at least have the decency to respond."
> "I guess I dodged a bullet."

Even if you're hurt, aggressive follow-ups make you look bad and don't accomplish anything.

### Don't Stalk Their Activity

Checking when they were last active, whether they updated their profile, or if they're still on the app will only make you feel worse.

### Don't Make It Mean Something About You

One person not responding doesn't mean:
- You're undesirable
- Your profile is bad
- No one will ever be interested
- There's something wrong with you

It means one person, for their own reasons, stopped responding. That's it.

## When Ghosting Hurts More

### After Plans Were Made

Getting ghosted after you've made plans to meet is particularly frustrating. You set aside time, maybe felt excited, and then... nothing.

**What to do:**
- Send one confirmation message the day before
- If no response, don't show up
- Process the disappointment
- Move on

### After Meeting

Getting ghosted after a date is harder because it feels more personal. You met, you thought it went well, and then silence.

**What to do:**
- Send one follow-up: "I had a good time yesterday. Would love to see you again if you're interested."
- If no response after a few days, accept it
- Remember: Their silence reflects their communication skills, not your worth

### After Intimacy

Getting ghosted after a sexual encounter is the most painful form. It can feel like you were used.

**What to do:**
- Allow yourself to feel hurt (it's valid)
- Recognize this says everything about them and nothing about you
- Talk to supportive friends if needed
- Be more cautious about intimacy before trust is established in the future

## Preventing Future Ghosting

You can't control others' behavior, but you can reduce ghosting likelihood:

### Vet Before Investing

Look for signs of genuine interest:
- They ask questions about you
- They share things about themselves
- They respond with substance, not just emojis
- They seem invested in the conversation

### Don't Over-Invest Early

If you're deeply emotionally invested after 10 messages with a stranger, you'll feel worse when it doesn't work out.

Keep perspective: You don't really know someone until you've spent significant time together.

### Move to Meeting Sooner

Endless messaging often leads to ghosting. The longer conversations go without meeting, the more likely they'll fizzle.

Suggest meeting after reasonable rapport is established.

### Watch for Patterns

If someone takes days to respond, gives minimal effort, or seems distracted, they may be on the way out. Don't be surprised if that leads to ghosting.

## Should You Ever Ghost?

Controversial take: Sometimes ghosting is appropriate.

**Acceptable to ghost:**
- After just a few messages exchanged
- When someone's being inappropriate
- When you feel unsafe
- When you've already clearly communicated disinterest and they persist

**Not acceptable to ghost:**
- After making plans to meet
- After meeting in person
- After intimacy
- After significant conversations

In most cases, a brief "I don't think we're a match, but good luck!" takes 10 seconds and treats the other person with basic respect.

## Reframing Ghosting

### It's a Filter

Ghosting shows you who someone is before you've invested much. Someone who ghosts would probably also:
- Avoid difficult conversations
- Struggle with emotional communication
- Cause bigger hurt later

Better to find out now.

### It's Common

You're not uniquely being ghosted. Studies suggest 20-30% of dating app conversations end in ghosting. It's practically standard.

### It's Not Personal

When someone ghosts, they're dealing with their own stuff—overwhelm, avoidance, life circumstances, other connections. It rarely has anything to do with you specifically.

### It Gets Easier

The more you date, the less each individual ghosting affects you. It stops feeling like rejection and starts feeling like just... noise.

## FAQ

**How long before it's officially ghosting?**
If someone regularly responded within hours and now hasn't responded in 3-4 days, you've probably been ghosted. But people's lives vary—some take longer naturally.

**Should I ever reach out again later?**
After months? Sometimes people come back. You can respond if you want, but go in without expectations. Patterns usually repeat.

**What if they come back?**
Up to you. If they apologize and explain, you might give them another chance. If they act like nothing happened, proceed with caution.

**How do I stop checking the app compulsively?**
Turn off notifications. Delete the app temporarily. Fill your time with other activities. Give yourself a set time to check once daily.
