One of the biggest concerns people have about joining Feeld is privacy. Will your Facebook friends see you? Will coworkers find your profile? Will that person you definitely don't want to explain your dating life to discover you're exploring ENM?

These are valid concerns, especially since Feeld historically used Facebook for login. This guide explains exactly how Feeld handles privacy, what your Facebook friends can and can't see, and how to maximize your discretion on the app.

## Can Facebook Friends See You on Feeld?

**The short answer:** Not through Facebook itself. But they could find you on Feeld if you're both users.

Let's break this down:

### What Facebook Can't See
- Feeld doesn't post to your Facebook
- Your Feeld activity never appears on Facebook
- Facebook friends can't see you're on Feeld through Facebook
- Your Feeld matches, messages, and activity are private

### What Facebook Friends Might See
- If a friend is also on Feeld, they could see your profile while browsing
- This has nothing to do with Facebook—it's just both of you being on the same app
- You appear to them the same way you'd appear to any stranger

**The risk isn't Facebook integration—it's simply that other people you know might also use Feeld.**

---

## Does Feeld Still Require Facebook?

Historically, Feeld required Facebook login. This has changed:

**Current login options:**
- Apple ID
- Google account
- Phone number
- Email (in some regions)
- Facebook (optional, not required)

If you're concerned about Facebook connection, simply sign up with a different method. Using Apple or Google login gives you the same experience without any Facebook link.

**If you already signed up with Facebook:**
You can continue using your account normally. Your Feeld profile is still not visible on Facebook. The Facebook login was only for verification.

## How to Maximize Privacy on Feeld

### 1. Use Incognito Mode (Majestic Feature)

Feeld's Incognito Mode is the most powerful privacy tool available. When enabled:

- Your profile is hidden from everyone
- You only appear to people YOU like first
- You can browse without being seen
- No one knows you're on the app unless you choose to reveal yourself

**How it works:**
1. Like someone's profile
2. Only then do they see you in their feed
3. If you don't like them, they never know you exist

**The catch:** Incognito Mode requires [Feeld Majestic (premium)](/feeld-guide/feeld-premium-worth-it). It's not available on free accounts.

For full details, see our [Feeld Incognito guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-incognito-guide).

### 2. Block Specific People

If there are specific people you want to avoid:

1. If you see them in your feed, tap the three dots
2. Select "Block" or "Hide"
3. They won't see you, and you won't see them

**Proactive blocking:**
You can't pre-emptively block someone you haven't encountered. But if you match accidentally, you can unmatch and block before any conversation happens.

### 3. Use Separate Photos

One of the easiest ways to be recognized is using the same photos as your Instagram or Facebook. Consider:

- Taking new photos specifically for dating apps
- Using photos that aren't anywhere else online
- Avoiding photos friends have seen on social media

This doesn't guarantee anonymity, but it reduces the chance of immediate recognition.

### 4. Don't Use Your Real Name in Bio

Feeld doesn't require your last name, and you can use a nickname or first initial. While you need real identity for account verification, your displayed name can be more private.

### 5. Be Thoughtful About Identifying Details

Your bio might contain details that make you identifiable:
- Specific job title
- Company name
- Neighborhood you live in
- Unique hobbies that people associate with you

Consider being slightly more general until you're comfortable with a match.

## What If Someone You Know Finds You?

It happens. Someone you know might discover your Feeld profile. Here's how to handle it:

### If They Don't Mention It
They probably feel as awkward as you do. Most people follow an unspoken rule: if we both see each other on a dating app, we pretend it didn't happen unless we both want to acknowledge it.

### If They Do Mention It
Options:
- Own it casually: "Yeah, I'm exploring some things. How about you?"
- Deflect: "Oh, I made that ages ago. Forgot it existed."
- Be direct: "I'd rather not discuss my dating life."

### If You're Both Actually Interested
Swipe right and see what happens. Some of the best connections come from existing comfort.

### If You Want to Avoid Future Encounters
Block them after seeing their profile. Neither of you will appear to each other again.

## The Psychology of Privacy Concerns

Here's something worth considering: most people on Feeld are also worried about their own privacy. If someone from your life is on the app, they're probably not eager to tell others they saw you there—because that would reveal they're on Feeld too.

**Mutual assured discretion** is real. Everyone has an interest in keeping things private.

The exceptions are situations where someone has nothing to lose by exposing you (an ex, someone with a grudge). For those cases, Incognito Mode is your best protection.

## Facebook Login: Should You Be Concerned?

If you signed up using Facebook, here's what Feeld actually accesses:

**What Feeld gets from Facebook:**
- Your name and age (for verification)
- Profile photo (as a starting photo)
- That's basically it

**What Feeld does NOT do:**
- Post on your timeline
- Access your friends list for matching
- Share your Feeld activity with Facebook
- Allow Facebook to see your Feeld matches

The Facebook login is purely for identity verification. It doesn't create any connection between your Facebook social life and your Feeld dating life.

## Alternative Sign-Up Methods

If you haven't joined yet or want to create a fresh account:

### Apple ID (Recommended for Privacy)
- Uses Apple's privacy-focused "Hide My Email" feature
- Can create a unique email for Feeld
- No connection to other accounts

### Google Account
- Quick and easy
- Use a separate Google account if you want extra separation

### Phone Number
- Simple verification
- No social media connection
- Some anonymity

### Email
- Where available, the most separate option
- Create a dedicated email for dating apps

## Privacy Comparison: Feeld vs Other Apps

| Privacy Feature | Feeld | Tinder | Hinge |
|-----------------|-------|--------|-------|
| Incognito Mode | Yes (paid) | Yes (paid) | No |
| Block Contacts | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Non-Facebook Login | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Doesn't Post to Social | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Hide from Specific People | Manual | Yes (block contacts) | Manual |

Feeld's privacy options are comparable to or better than mainstream apps, especially with Incognito Mode.

## When You Really Need Maximum Privacy

For people who absolutely cannot be seen on a dating app (public figures, certain professions, specific personal situations):

### Consider:
1. **Incognito Mode** - Only appear to people you choose
2. **Separate photos** - Nothing from your public life
3. **Vague bio** - No identifying details
4. **Nickname** - Don't use your common name
5. **New email** - Separate from personal accounts

### Accept:
- You can't be 100% invisible and also find matches
- Some risk exists on any dating platform
- If discovered, have a planned response ready

### Alternatives:
- Consider apps with built-in privacy features
- Look for communities with in-person events instead
- Ask trusted friends for introductions

## Privacy Is Normal

Final thought: there's nothing wrong with wanting privacy on a dating app. You're not hiding something shameful—you're being appropriately careful about your personal life.

Most Feeld users share this concern. The app's privacy features exist because the community asked for them. Use them without guilt.
