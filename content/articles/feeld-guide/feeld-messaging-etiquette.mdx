Feeld attracts open-minded people, but open-minded doesn't mean "anything goes." Good messaging etiquette helps you stand out and creates connections worth having.

Here are the unwritten rules of Feeld messaging.

---

## First Message Etiquette

### Do Read Their Profile

**Before messaging:**
- Actually read what they wrote
- Notice their interests and desires
- Reference something specific
- Show you paid attention

**Why it matters:**
- Shows genuine interest
- Demonstrates effort
- Creates conversation opening
- Separates you from lazy messages

### Don't Lead with the Explicit

**Unless they've indicated openness:**
- Keep first messages appropriate
- Sexual content comes later if at all
- Build rapport first
- Read the room

**Exceptions:**
- Profiles explicitly inviting explicit messages
- Clear sexual context in their profile
- Even then, consent first

### Do Make It Easy to Respond

**Good openers:**
- Ask a question
- Reference something specific
- Give them something to work with
- Show your personality

**Not this:**
- "Hey"
- "Hi beautiful"
- "Looking to chat?"
- Generic compliments

## Ongoing Conversation Etiquette

### Match Their Energy

**Observe:**
- How much are they writing?
- How quickly do they respond?
- What's their tone?
- What are they engaging with?

**Adjust:**
- Don't overwhelm with paragraphs if they send sentences
- Don't be terse if they're expressive
- Find mutual pace

### Response Time Expectations

**Reasonable:**
- People have lives
- Hours between messages is normal
- Don't send follow-up messages demanding response
- Be patient

**Red flags:**
- Demanding immediate responses
- Getting angry about delays
- "Did I do something wrong?" after 2 hours
- Excessive checking in

### Don't Let Conversations Die

**If you're interested:**
- Keep momentum going
- Ask questions back
- Share about yourself
- Move toward meeting if appropriate

**If you're not:**
- Be honest (see below)
- Don't ghost if you've had real conversation
- A simple "not feeling the connection" is fine

## When Messaging Couples

### Address Both People

**Good practice:**
- Acknowledge both exist
- Direct messages to both
- Don't obviously favor one
- Respect that they're a unit

### Ask About Their Dynamic

**Clarify:**
- Do they date together or separately?
- Who will you be meeting?
- What are they looking for?
- Who makes decisions?

### Don't Try to Separate Them

**Unless invited:**
- Don't offer to meet just one
- Don't badmouth one to the other
- Respect their relationship
- They're a package deal

## Discussing Desires

### When to Bring Up Specifics

**Good timing:**
- After establishing mutual interest
- Before meeting to ensure compatibility
- When conversation naturally goes there
- When they've brought it up

**Bad timing:**
- First message
- Before any rapport
- Out of nowhere
- Repeatedly after they've redirected

### How to Ask About Kink/Desires

**Good approaches:**
- "What are you exploring on Feeld?"
- "I noticed we share [interest]—tell me more"
- Reference their listed desires
- Be specific but not graphic initially

### Respecting Boundaries

**If they:**
- Don't want to discuss certain topics yet
- Set limits on conversation content
- Seem uncomfortable

**You should:**
- Respect that immediately
- Not push or negotiate
- Continue with appropriate topics
- Check if they want to continue at all

---

## Photo Etiquette

### Unsolicited Content

**Never send:**
- Explicit photos without asking first
- Anything they didn't request
- Photos as a conversation opener
- Content without consent

### Requesting Photos

**Good approach:**
- Ask politely
- Accept "no" gracefully
- Wait until appropriate in conversation
- Don't pressure

### Private Photos Feature

**When requesting access:**
- Do it after some rapport
- Accept if they decline
- Don't screenshot and share
- Treat access as trust earned

---

## Moving to Meeting

### When to Suggest

**Good timing:**
- Conversation flows well
- Mutual interest is clear
- Basic compatibility established
- Both seem engaged

### How to Suggest

**Good approaches:**
- "Would you be interested in meeting for a drink?"
- "I'm enjoying our conversation—want to continue in person?"
- Specific suggestion shows intention

**Not ideal:**
- Demanding to meet immediately
- "When are you free?" with no context
- Pressuring after hesitation

### If They're Not Ready

**Respect it:**
- Continue chatting if they want
- Don't pressure
- Understand people have reasons
- They may just need time

---

## Handling Rejection

### If They're Not Interested

**Good responses:**
- "No worries, best of luck!"
- "Thanks for letting me know"
- Nothing at all is fine too

**Not okay:**
- Insulting them
- Demanding reasons
- Continued messaging
- Anger or bitterness

### Delivering Rejection

**Good ways:**
- "I'm not feeling a connection, but best of luck"
- "I don't think we're looking for the same things"
- Brief and kind
- You don't owe lengthy explanation

---

## Unmatching and Ghosting

### When It's Okay

**Unmatching without explanation:**
- Very early (before real conversation)
- After receiving inappropriate messages
- When you feel unsafe
- Anytime you want, really

### When to Say Something

**Consider a message if:**
- You've had substantial conversation
- You've made plans
- They've invested time
- Basic courtesy applies

### Ghosting Etiquette

**The spectrum:**
- Pre-conversation: Fine to just unmatch
- Mid-conversation: A brief "not feeling it" is kind
- Post-meeting: Definitely say something

---

## For Couples Messaging

### Present as Unified

**Good practice:**
- Both on the account? Both engage
- Clear who's writing
- Consistent voice
- Not good cop/bad cop

### Don't Overwhelm Singles

**Be mindful:**
- Two people messaging can be a lot
- Match their energy
- Don't double-team them
- Respect their pace

### Be Clear About Dynamics

**Explain:**
- What you're looking for
- How you date
- What the dynamic would be
- Who they'd be meeting

---

## ENM/Poly Specifics

### Disclosing Relationship Status

**Be upfront about:**
- Existing partners
- Relationship structure
- What you're available for
- Constraints on time/availability

### Asking About Others

**Good to ask:**
- "What's your current situation?"
- "Are you seeing other people?"
- "What does your partner know about you dating?"

### Metamour Considerations

**Respect:**
- Their other relationships
- Time constraints
- Communication needs with partners
- That you're not the only one

## FAQ

**How long should I wait to message after matching?**
No specific timeline—message when you have something good to say. Same day is fine, a few days later is fine too.

**What if they don't respond to my first message?**
Move on. One follow-up after a week is acceptable, but if no response, they're not interested.

**Is it rude to unmatch without saying anything?**
For early matches with little conversation, it's normal. After substantial exchange, a brief message is kinder.

**How direct should I be about what I want?**
Be clear but build some rapport first. Feeld is open, but humans still appreciate connection before negotiation.
