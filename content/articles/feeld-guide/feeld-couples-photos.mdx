## Essential Photo Types for Couples

### 1. Clear Photo of Each Individual

**For each person:**
- Solo photo or clearly individual
- Face visible and clear
- Representative of their appearance
- Equal quality for both partners

**Why this matters:**
- People need to see who you each are
- Avoids "bait and switch" feeling
- Shows both are real individuals
- Lets people evaluate attraction to each

### 2. Photo Together

**At least one photo showing:**
- Both of you together
- Your dynamic visible
- Both looking happy/engaged
- Chemistry between you

**This establishes:**
- You're actually a couple
- How you interact
- Your relationship energy
- What being with both of you might feel like

### 3. Activity/Interest Photos

**Show what you're about:**
- Hobbies you share
- How you spend time
- Your lifestyle
- What doing things with you looks like

## Common Couple Photo Mistakes

### Only Couple Photos, No Individuals

**The problem:**
- Hard to see each person clearly
- Can't evaluate individuals
- Feels like hiding something
- One person always partially obscured

**The fix:**
- Include clear individual photos
- Each person should be clearly visible
- Balance couple and solo shots

### Unequal Photo Quality

**The problem:**
- One partner has great photos
- Other partner has poor photos
- Signals who's "running" the profile
- Creates attraction imbalance

**The fix:**
- Equal quality for both
- Same effort for both people
- If one has no good photos, take new ones together

### One Partner Looks Reluctant

**The problem:**
- One person seems less enthusiastic
- Forced smile or closed body language
- Obvious who wanted this more
- Red flag for potential matches

**The fix:**
- Only use photos where both look happy
- If one partner isn't into it, that's a conversation to have
- Genuine enthusiasm matters

### Wedding/Formal Photos Only

**The problem:**
- See you dressed up, not in real life
- May be old
- Doesn't show everyday you
- Too stiff and formal

**The fix:**
- Include casual photos
- Show everyday versions of yourselves
- Variety of contexts

## FAQ

**Should we have separate individual profiles too?**
It depends on what you're seeking. Some couples have both. Feeld allows linking profiles if you want both options.

**What if one partner isn't photogenic?**
Practice, good lighting, and taking many photos helps. Everyone can have good photos with enough attempts.

**Should we include photos with past thirds?**
Generally no—it's like including ex photos. Focus on the two of you.

**How many photos should a couple profile have?**
5-8 is good. Enough to show both individuals and the dynamic without overwhelming.
