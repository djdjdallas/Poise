## Good Times to Upgrade

### When You're Actively Dating

**Upgrade when:**

### When Free Has Hit Its Limits

**Signs you've maxed out free:**

- Filters aren't specific enough
- Profile is optimized but want more efficiency

**Wait if:**
- You haven't optimized your profile
- Not consistently using daily likes
- Haven't given free a real try
- Still learning the app

### When Time > Money

**Upgrade makes sense if:**
- Your time is valuable

**Wait if:**

## Times to Wait

### Before Profile Is Ready

**Don't upgrade if:**
- Your profile isn't optimized
- Photos need work
- Bio is weak or generic

**Why wait:**

- Optimize first, then supercharge

### When You're New to Feeld

**Hold off if:**
- You just downloaded the app
- Still learning how it works
- Not sure if Feeld is for you
- Just exploring

**Why wait:**
- Learn the app on free first
- Understand what features you'd use
- Make informed upgrade decision
- Don't pay before knowing value

### During Dating Breaks

**Skip subscription when:**
- You're taking time off from dating
- Other life priorities dominate
- You won't use the app much
- Just maintaining, not pursuing

**Why:**
- Don't pay for unused features
- Resume when active again
- Match subscription to activity

### When Free Is Working

**Don't fix what's not broken:**
- Getting matches you can handle
- Results are satisfying
- Not hitting limits
- Free meets your needs

## Upgrade Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Active Seeker

**Profile:** Great photos and bio, consistent app use, hitting daily limits, wants efficiency

**Verdict:** Good time to upgrade. You'll use the features and benefit from efficiency gains.

### Scenario 2: The Casual Browser

**Profile:** Decent profile, checks app few times a week, doesn't hit limits, content with current results

**Verdict:** Wait. Free is serving you fine. Upgrade when usage increases.

### Scenario 3: The New User

**Verdict:** Definitely wait. Learn the app, optimize profile, then evaluate.

### Scenario 4: The Frustrated User

**Profile:** Few matches, poor results, considering quitting, thinks premium might help

### Scenario 5: The Privacy-Conscious User
