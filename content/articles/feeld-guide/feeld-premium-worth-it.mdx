Feeld's premium subscription is called "Majestic"—and unlike some dating apps where premium feels optional, Feeld's free tier can be limiting enough that you might actually consider paying. But is it worth it?

This guide breaks down exactly what you get with Feeld Majestic, what the free version lacks, and who should (and shouldn't) subscribe. We'll give you an honest analysis to help you decide if the investment makes sense for your situation.

## What Is Feeld Majestic?

Majestic is Feeld's premium subscription tier. It unlocks features that are restricted on the free version and adds capabilities designed to make finding connections easier and more efficient.

The name "Majestic" fits Feeld's brand aesthetic—elevated, tasteful, a bit whimsical. But beyond the branding, what do you actually get?

---

## Majestic Features Breakdown

Let's go through each major feature and assess its real value:

### 1. See Who Liked You

**What it is:** View a list of everyone who has liked your profile, without needing to match first.

**Free version:** You can't see who liked you. You only find out when you also like them (creating a match).

**Value assessment:** **HIGH**

This is arguably the most valuable premium feature. On free Feeld, you're swiping blind—you might scroll past someone who already liked you without knowing it. Seeing your likes lets you:
- Prioritize people who are already interested
- Stop wasting time on people who aren't
- Respond to interest rather than just broadcasting it

For active users, this feature alone can justify the subscription. It's especially valuable if you're selective about who you like—you're no longer dependent on mutual blind matching.

### 2. Advanced Filters

**What it is:** Filter your discover feed by more criteria—including specific desires, age range, and more precise preferences.

**Free version:** Limited filtering options.

**Value assessment:** **MEDIUM-HIGH**

Feeld's user base includes diverse desires and relationship structures. Advanced filters let you narrow down to exactly what you're looking for:
- Only see singles (if you're not interested in couples)
- Filter by specific desires or kinks
- Narrow by age range more precisely
- Focus on specific relationship structures

If you find yourself scrolling past lots of incompatible profiles on free Feeld, better filters can save significant time. They're especially valuable in larger cities with more users.

### 3. Incognito Mode

**What it is:** Browse without being visible to others unless you like them first. Your profile is hidden until you take action.

**Free version:** Your profile is always visible to people you match the criteria for.

**Value assessment:** **VARIES**

The value here depends entirely on your situation:

**High value if you:**
- Need discretion (public figure, concerned about work, etc.)
- Want to control who sees you
- Prefer to initiate all connections
- Are in a location where you might encounter people you know

**Lower value if you:**
- Don't mind being visible
- Want to maximize inbound interest
- Aren't concerned about privacy

For some users, Incognito is non-negotiable. For others, it's a feature they'd never use. Know your needs.

### 4. Activity Status

**What it is:** See when other users were last active on the app.

**Free version:** No visibility into when people were last online.

**Value assessment:** **MEDIUM**

This helps you gauge who's actively using the app versus who made a profile and forgot about it. Benefits:
- Prioritize messaging active users
- Understand if someone's just slow to respond vs. inactive
- Avoid investing time in dead profiles

It's not a game-changer, but it adds useful context to your decision-making.

### 5. More Pings

**What it is:** Additional pings (Feeld's version of super-likes) to send to profiles you're especially interested in.

**Free version:** Limited number of pings.

**Value assessment:** **MEDIUM**

If you use pings strategically, having more of them is helpful. But pings only matter if you're using them well—spamming pings doesn't work regardless of quantity. This feature is most valuable if you frequently run out of pings.

### 6. Unlimited Rewinds

**What it is:** Undo accidental left swipes (rejections) without limit.

**Free version:** Limited or no rewinds.

**Value assessment:** **LOW-MEDIUM**

How often do you accidentally swipe left on someone you wanted to like? For most users, this isn't a common problem. But if you're a fast swiper or have accidentally rejected great profiles, unlimited rewinds can help.

### 7. Premium Badge

**What it is:** A visual indicator on your profile showing you're a Majestic member.

**Free version:** No badge.

**Value assessment:** **LOW**

Does a premium badge help you get matches? Probably not significantly. Some might interpret it as showing you're serious about the app. Others might not notice or care. Don't subscribe for the badge.

### 8. Additional Features (May Vary)

Feeld occasionally adds or adjusts premium features. Other current or past features include:
- Priority in the queue (your profile shown to more people)
- Advanced hide settings (hide from specific demographics)
- Expanded match radius options

## Who Should Get Majestic

Based on our analysis, Majestic makes sense for:

### Heavy Users

If you're on Feeld regularly (daily or near-daily), Majestic features compound over time. Seeing who liked you daily, filtering efficiently, and having more pings all add up.

### Privacy-Conscious Users

If Incognito mode is important to you, Majestic is essentially required. There's no free way to browse invisibly.

### Selective Daters

If you're specific about what you're looking for, advanced filters and seeing likes can dramatically improve your experience. Instead of swiping through hundreds of incompatible profiles, you can focus on the ones that matter.

### People in Large Cities

In cities with substantial Feeld user bases, filtering becomes more important because there's more noise to cut through. Majestic helps you navigate volume.

### Couples

Couples often face unique challenges on Feeld—lots of attention, need to filter efficiently, privacy concerns. Majestic features address these.

### Serious Explorers

If you're genuinely using Feeld to explore ENM, kink, or alternative connections—not just casually browsing—investing in better tools makes sense.

---

## Who Shouldn't Get Majestic

Majestic might not be worth it if you're:

### Occasional Users

If you check Feeld once a week or less, premium features won't deliver much value. You're not on the app enough to benefit.

### Budget Constrained

If money is tight, free Feeld is still functional. You can absolutely find connections without paying—it just requires more patience and less efficiency.

### In Small Markets

In areas with limited Feeld users, premium features have less impact. There simply aren't enough profiles for advanced filtering to matter much.

### Just Curious

If you're just downloading Feeld to see what it's about, don't subscribe immediately. Use the free version to understand the app first.

### Not Seeing Results on Free

If you're getting zero matches on free Feeld, Majestic probably won't fix that. The issue is likely your profile or photos, not feature access. Fix the fundamentals first.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

Let's do some rough math:

**Scenario: Active urban single user**

- Majestic cost: ~$15/month (6-month subscription)
- Time saved per month (better filtering, seeing likes): ~2-4 hours
- Additional quality matches per month: ~2-5
- Cost per additional connection: ~$3-7.50

If your time is valuable and you'd go on dates with those additional matches, the math works out. A couple of coffee dates cost more than a month of Majestic.

**Scenario: Occasional user in smaller city**

- Majestic cost: ~$30/month (1-month subscription)
- Time saved per month: ~30 minutes
- Additional matches per month: ~0-1
- Cost per additional connection: $30+

The math doesn't work as well here. You might be better off saving the money.

## Trying Before Buying

A few tips for assessing whether Majestic is worth it for you:

### Use Free Version First

Spend at least 2-3 weeks on free Feeld to understand:
- How active the app is in your area
- What your match rate looks like
- What frustrations you experience that Majestic might solve

### Look for Free Trials

Feeld occasionally offers free trials of Majestic. If you see one, take it—experience the features before committing.

### Start with 1 Month

If you decide to try Majestic, start with a 1-month subscription. Yes, it's more expensive per month, but you can evaluate whether it's helping before committing to a longer term.

### Evaluate After One Month

After a month of Majestic, ask:
- Did I find more compatible matches?
- Did the features actually improve my experience?
- Would I miss these features if I downgraded?

## Majestic vs. Other Premium Dating Apps

How does Feeld Majestic compare?

| Feature | Feeld Majestic | Tinder Gold | Hinge Premium |
|---------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| See likes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Advanced filters | Yes | Limited | Yes |
| Incognito | Yes | Limited | No |
| Price (monthly) | ~$15-30 | ~$15-30 | ~$35-50 |
| Unique features | ENM-focused | Large user base | Relationship-focused |

Majestic is competitively priced and offers a solid feature set for its price point. The main differentiation is the app itself—Feeld serves a specific community that mainstream apps don't address as well.

---

## Maximizing Majestic Value

If you do subscribe, make sure you're getting full value:

### Actually Use the Features

It sounds obvious, but check your likes regularly, use filters intentionally, and take advantage of what you're paying for.

### Adjust Filters Over Time

Your preferences might evolve. Revisit your filter settings periodically.

### Use Incognito Strategically

If you're paying for it, understand how it works. You can toggle it on/off depending on your needs.

### Don't Waste Pings

More pings doesn't mean spam them. Keep using them for genuinely exciting profiles.

---

## Verdict: Is Majestic Worth It?

**Yes, if:**
- You use Feeld regularly
- You're in a larger market with many users
- Specific features (seeing likes, Incognito, filters) solve real problems for you
- You can comfortably afford it
- You're serious about finding connections

**No, if:**
- You're a casual, occasional user
- You're in a small market
- You're not experiencing limitations with free Feeld
- The cost is a stretch financially
- You haven't optimized your profile first

**The honest answer:** Majestic is a nice-to-have, not a must-have. Free Feeld is functional and many people find great connections without paying. But if you're serious about the app and value your time, Majestic can meaningfully improve the experience.
