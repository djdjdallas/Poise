Couples on Feeld can find amazing connections—but they also face unique skepticism. Many people have had bad experiences with couples who treat thirds as accessories rather than people.

Here's how to create a couple profile that stands out for the right reasons.

## The Couple Challenge on Feeld

### Why Couples Face Skepticism

**Historical problems:**
- "Unicorn hunting" has a bad reputation
- Couples treating thirds as disposable
- Entitlement without offering anything in return
- One partner driving while the other isn't really interested

### Your Goal

**Profile should:**
- Show you treat potential connections as full people
- Demonstrate you've thought about what you're offering
- Prove both partners are genuinely interested
- Attract people who want what you're looking for

---

## Joint Profile vs. Linked Profiles

### Option 1: Joint Profile

**When it works:**
- You always date together
- You're clearly a package deal
- You're comfortable sharing an account
- You're seeking thirds for shared experiences

**Best practices:**
- Make clear who's who in photos
- Both partners contribute to bio
- Sign messages with names or initials
- Show both personalities, not just one

### Option 2: Linked Individual Profiles

**When it works:**
- You date separately and/or together
- You want individual identity
- Different interests between partners
- More flexibility in how you connect

**Best practices:**
- Link profiles in relationship status
- Mention partner in bio
- Be clear about what's individual vs. shared
- Coordinate to tell consistent story

---

## Photo Strategy for Couples

### Joint Profile Photos

**Include:**
- Photos of both of you together
- Individual photos of each person (clearly labeled)
- Clear face shots of both partners
- Full body shots of both partners

**Avoid:**
- All photos are just one partner
- Can't tell who's who
- Only sexual/suggestive photos
- Photos where one person is cropped out (exes, etc.)

### Photo Quality

**Standards:**
- Both people look good (not just one)
- Both appear interested and present
- Chemistry between you is visible
- Authentic representation of both

### What Photos Communicate

**Consider:**
- Do your photos show both people as desirable?
- Does one partner look reluctant?
- Is there visible affection/chemistry?
- Would someone be attracted to both of you from photos?

## Bio Strategy for Couples

### The "We" vs. "I" Balance

**Find balance:**
- Speak as a unit when appropriate
- But show individual personalities
- Don't lose individuals in "we"
- Example: "We're looking for [X]. [Name] is especially interested in [Y], while [Name] loves [Z]"

### What to Include

**Essential elements:**
- Who you both are (briefly)
- Your relationship context (how long together, etc.)
- What you're looking for
- What you're offering
- How you prefer to connect

### Addressing the Unicorn Hunter Perception

**Show you're different by:**
- Acknowledging potential third as a full person
- Stating what you offer, not just what you want
- Showing genuine interest in getting to know someone
- Being clear about expectations without being demanding

**Example:**
> "We know couples have a bad reputation. We're here to meet someone we genuinely connect with—not a fantasy accessory. We're happy to invest in getting to know you and building something real."

### What You're Looking For

**Be specific and realistic:**
- Not just "seeking our unicorn"
- What kind of connection? Ongoing? Occasional?
- Together only, or individual connections too?
- What dynamics interest you?

---

## What You're Offering

### The "What's In It for Them" Question

**Potential thirds often wonder:**
- Will I be treated as a person or a sex toy?
- Is this a one-time thing or ongoing?
- Do they actually care about me?
- What do I get out of this?

### Articulate Your Value

**Consider including:**
- What you're like to spend time with
- What a connection with you looks like
- How you treat the people you date
- What kind of experience you create

**Example:**
> "We're fun to be around—we love cooking together, long conversations, and making people feel welcomed. We're looking for someone who wants to be genuinely included, not just invited over."

## Common Couple Mistakes

### Mistake 1: The Invisible Partner

**Problem:** Bio and photos focus on one person (usually the woman)
**Impact:** Seems like bait-and-switch; who's the other person?
**Fix:** Equal representation of both partners

### Mistake 2: The Reluctant Partner

**Problem:** One partner seems less interested in photos/bio
**Impact:** Feels like one person is being dragged along
**Fix:** Both need to be genuinely engaged

### Mistake 3: The Checklist

**Problem:** Long list of requirements for potential thirds
**Impact:** Feels demanding and entitled
**Fix:** Focus on what you offer, not just what you want

### Mistake 4: The Fantasy Focus

**Problem:** Profile is all about the sexual scenario you want
**Impact:** Dehumanizing; who would actually want this?
**Fix:** Treat profile like you're looking for a person, not a prop

### Mistake 5: The One-Size-Fits-All

**Problem:** Mass-messaging everyone with same copy-paste
**Impact:** Feels impersonal and desperate
**Fix:** Personal, thoughtful outreach

## Messaging as a Couple

### Who Sends Messages

**Options:**
- One person handles messaging (clear about this)
- Both actively participate
- Trade off

**Whatever you choose:**
- Be clear who's writing
- Sign messages with names
- Don't pretend to be one person if you're both involved

### First Message Approach

**Do:**
- Reference something specific about their profile
- Introduce both of you
- Ask something about them as a person
- Be warm and non-presumptuous

**Don't:**
- Lead with sexual content
- Copy-paste the same message
- Message only about what you want
- Ignore that they're a full person

### Transparency

**Be honest about:**
- Your relationship structure
- What you're looking for
- What your timeline is
- How connected you both are to this outreach

---

## Navigating Conversations

### Including Both Partners

**As conversation develops:**
- Make sure both partners are engaged
- Don't let one person do all the work
- The third should get to know both of you
- Video calls with all three can help

### Setting Expectations

**Be clear about:**
- What a first meeting looks like
- What you're hoping for longer-term
- How you handle things if it works/doesn't work
- How you communicate as a couple

---

## Meeting and Beyond

### First Meeting Tips

**For couples:**
- All three people should be present
- Public location first
- No pressure for anything physical
- Focus on genuine connection

### Being Good Partners

**What distinguishes good couples:**
- Treating the third as equal, not accessory
- Checking in about their experience
- Not making decisions about them without them
- Investing in the connection genuinely

## FAQ

**Should we have one profile or two?**
Depends on how you date. Joint if you're always together; separate if you have individual connections. Both can work.

**How do we handle rejection?**
Gracefully. Thank them for their time, wish them well. Don't make it weird.

**What if people assume we're unicorn hunters?**
Some will assume regardless. Show through your profile and behavior that you're different. Those who are open will engage.

**One of us gets more attention—is that normal?**
Yes, very common. The question is whether you can work with that or if it creates problems.
