## The Outside Perspective Test

### Get Feedback

**Ask trusted friends:**
- What vibe do you get from this profile?
- What kind of person do you think this is?
- What would you assume they're looking for?
- Would you swipe right? Why or why not?

### Fresh Eyes

**Or do it yourself:**
- Step away from your profile for a few days
- Come back and look at it as if seeing for the first time
- What stands out?
- What's missing?

## Common Profile Mistakes

### Mistake 1: The Blank Slate

**Problem:** Minimal bio, few photos, nothing to work with
**Impact:** No reason to swipe right or start conversation
**Fix:** Add substance in both photos and bio

### Mistake 2: The Negative Nancy

**Problem:** Bio full of "don't message if" and complaints
**Impact:** Seems bitter, unapproachable
**Fix:** Focus on what you DO want, not what you don't

### Mistake 3: The Mystery

**Problem:** So vague that no one knows what you're looking for
**Impact:** Only desperate people swipe; others don't bother
**Fix:** Be clear and specific about intentions

### Mistake 4: The Overseller

**Problem:** Too long, too much, trying too hard
**Impact:** Overwhelming, seems desperate
**Fix:** Edit down, leave some mystery, be confident

### Mistake 5: The Catfish

**Problem:** Photos don't represent current reality
**Impact:** Disappointment on both sides when meeting
**Fix:** Use recent, accurate photos
