Couples looking for a third have a reputation problem. "Unicorn hunting" has become synonymous with treating single people as accessories rather than full humans—and many experienced ENM folks are rightfully wary.

But wanting to date as a couple isn't inherently unethical. The difference is in how you approach it. This guide covers how to use Feeld to find a third in a way that's respectful, honest, and actually attractive to the kind of people you want to meet.

## Why "Unicorn Hunting" Gets a Bad Name

Before fixing the problem, understand what you're avoiding:

**Classic unicorn hunter behaviors:**
- Treating the third as an addition to your relationship rather than a person
- Expecting the third to date both of you equally with no independent relationships
- Having a "veto" where either partner can end things unilaterally
- Expecting more emotional labor from the third than you give
- Disappearing when the relationship becomes inconvenient
- Prioritizing the couple's comfort over the third's needs

**Why people avoid couples:**
- Past bad experiences with the above
- Feeling like a sex toy rather than a person
- Being disposed of when the couple has issues
- Unequal power dynamics
- Lack of respect for their autonomy

---

## The Ethical Alternative

Ethical couple dating means:

### Treating the Third as a Full Person

They have their own:
- Needs and boundaries
- Time constraints and priorities
- Other relationships (potentially)
- Right to say no to anything
- Value beyond what they add to your relationship

### Offering Something Real

What are you actually offering a third?
- Two people who care about their wellbeing?
- Genuine connection and good times?
- Flexibility in how the relationship develops?
- Respect for their autonomy?

If you can't articulate what's in it for them, reconsider your approach.

### Being Flexible About Structure

The best couple-third dynamics often look different than expected:
- The third might connect more with one partner
- Relationships might develop at different speeds
- Group activities might not be the main event
- The dynamic will evolve over time

Rigid expectations ("we all have to do everything together always") are red flags.

## Setting Up Your Feeld Profiles

### Both Partners Need Quality Profiles

Don't create one shared profile—use Feeld's pairing feature:

1. Each partner creates an individual profile
2. Link your profiles together
3. Both profiles should be complete and compelling

**Why individual profiles matter:**
- Shows you're both real, invested people
- Potential thirds can learn about each of you
- Signals you understand how Feeld works
- Feels less like being approached by an entity

### What Each Profile Needs

**Photos:**
- Clear individual photos of each person
- At least one photo together
- Each person should look good (not just one partner)

**Bio:**
- Who you are as an individual
- Brief mention of your couple situation
- What you're looking for
- Something that invites conversation

**Desires:**
- Singles (if seeking individuals)
- Threesome (if applicable)
- Open relationship
- Whatever accurately describes what you want

## Your Bio: What to Say

### Be Honest About Your Situation

**Include:**
- That you're a couple
- How long you've been together
- Your experience level with ENM
- What you're genuinely looking for

**Example:**
> Together 5 years, exploring ENM for 2. We date together and separately—looking for someone who might enjoy both. No pressure on what that becomes.

### Be Clear About Flexibility

Signal that you're not rigid:

> We've learned that the best connections have their own shape. Open to seeing what develops.

> Looking for connection first, and we'll figure out what that looks like together.

### Avoid Red Flag Language

**Don't say:**
- "Looking for our third" (possessive)
- "Must be attracted to both of us equally" (unrealistic)
- "No drama" (dismissive)
- "Looking for a unicorn" (even ironically, it's a red flag)

**Do say:**
- "Looking for someone who might click with us"
- "Open to connections developing naturally"
- "Interested in people who want to get to know both of us"

## Approaching Potential Thirds

### First Message Matters

Your opening message should:
- Be from one person (not "we")
- Reference something specific from their profile
- Not immediately mention sex or threesomes
- Treat them like a person you want to know

**Bad opener:**
> Hey! We think you're hot. Want to join us? 😏

**Better opener:**
> Hi! I noticed you're into hiking too—have you done any good trails lately? I'm [name], partnered with [partner]. Thought your profile was great and wanted to say hi.

### When to Mention the Couple Situation

If your profiles are paired, they already know. You can:
- Let them bring it up
- Mention naturally in conversation
- Answer questions honestly when asked

Don't make every message about your couple status.

### Responding to Questions

Common questions you'll get:
- "What are you looking for?"
- "How does this work with your partner?"
- "Do you date separately?"
- "What happens if one of you catches feelings?"

Have thoughtful answers ready. Vague responses signal you haven't thought this through.

## Building an Ethical Dynamic

### Early Conversations Should Establish

- What everyone is looking for
- How communication will work
- Whether separate connections are okay
- How you'll handle challenges
- That the third can always set boundaries

### Ongoing Practices

- Check in with the third about their experience
- Don't gang up in disagreements
- Give the third space to connect with each partner
- Respect their other relationships and time
- Be responsive to feedback

### Red Flags You Might Be Missing

Ask yourselves:
- Are we treating [third] the same way we'd want to be treated?
- Would we be comfortable if the roles were reversed?
- Is [third] getting as much out of this as we are?
- Are we making assumptions about their availability?

---

## What Ethical Thirds Are Looking For

People open to dating couples typically want:

**Genuine connection** - Not just being a sexual experience

**Respect for their time** - Not assumed to be always available

**Clear communication** - Knowing where they stand

**Flexibility** - Room for the relationship to be what it is

**Safety** - Emotional and physical

**Autonomy** - Not being controlled or possessed

If you can offer these things, say so in your profile and demonstrate them in your behavior.

## Handling Challenges

### When There's Unequal Connection

It's common for a third to connect more with one partner. Options:
- Accept that relationships develop differently
- Give space for individual connections
- Don't force equal feelings
- Communicate openly about dynamics

**Don't:** Make the third feel guilty for natural chemistry

### When Your Relationship Has Issues

Your couple problems shouldn't become the third's problems:
- Don't use them as a relationship band-aid
- Don't put them in the middle of conflicts
- Don't disappear when things get hard
- Be honest if you need to pause

### When It's Not Working

End things ethically:
- Have real conversations (not just ghosting)
- Acknowledge their feelings
- Thank them for the time you shared
- Don't blame them for couple issues

---

## The Long Game

Building a reputation as ethical couple daters:
- Word travels in ENM communities
- Past thirds may recommend you to friends
- Your behavior now affects future options
- Being ethical is its own reward

---

## Finding Your Person
