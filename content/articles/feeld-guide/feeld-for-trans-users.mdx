## Profile Strategy

### Disclosure Decisions

**You decide:**
- How visible to make trans identity
- When to disclose if not in profile
- How much detail to share

**Options:**
1. **Prominent disclosure** - In bio and identity settings
2. **Subtle disclosure** - In identity settings, not emphasized
3. **Match-by-match** - Disclose during conversation
4. **Private** - Disclose when you choose

**Each has tradeoffs:**
- Prominent: filters early but may attract chasers
- Subtle: more matches, more explaining
- Private: control timing, but may face rejection later

### Bio Writing

**If disclosing in bio:**
> "Trans woman looking for genuine connections. I'm out and proud—just want to find people who see me for me, not a category."

**If not emphasizing:**
> "Looking for thoughtful people interested in real connection. Coffee enthusiast, amateur photographer, probably funnier than my profile suggests."

### Photos

**Considerations:**
- Present yourself authentically
- No obligation to "prove" anything
- Show your personality
- What makes you feel confident

Your choice entirely. Prominent disclosure filters early but may attract chasers. Later disclosure gives you control but may lead to later rejection. Do what feels safest.

Clear profile helps. Some people won't read it anyway. Unmatch quickly, don't waste energy on those who don't respect you.

**Is Feeld safer than other apps?**
