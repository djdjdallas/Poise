Women on Feeld receive far more messages than they can realistically respond to. Your message is competing with dozens of others—many of which are low-effort or inappropriate.

To get responses, you need to stand out. Here's how to write opening messages that actually work.

---

## Understanding the Context

### The Reality of Her Inbox

Women on Feeld (especially on popular platforms):
- Receive significantly more matches than men
- Get many messages they won't respond to
- Have to filter quickly
- Develop pattern recognition for bad messages

### What She's Filtering For

**Quick filters (to eliminate messages):**
- Sexual content too early
- Generic "hey" messages
- Obvious copy-paste
- Negging or backhanded compliments
- Bad grammar/effort

**What catches attention:**
- Specific references to her profile
- Genuine curiosity
- Respectful tone with personality
- Something that makes her want to respond

### Your Goal

Your opener should:
- Show you read her profile
- Be interesting enough to warrant a response
- Avoid common mistakes
- Start a conversation (not demand attention)

## Openers That Work

### Profile-Specific Openers

**Reference something specific:**

> "Your photo from [location] caught my eye—I've always wanted to visit. What was your favorite part of that trip?"

> "You mentioned being into [interest]—I'm curious, how did you get into that?"

> "I love that you put [specific thing] in your bio. That's refreshing. What draws you to that?"

**Why it works:** Shows you actually read her profile, distinguishes you from mass-messagers.

### Curiosity-Based Openers

**Ask a real question:**

> "Your profile is intriguing but leaves me with questions. Like, what's the story behind [something in her profile]?"

> "I'm curious what brings you to Feeld specifically—everyone seems to have a different story."

> "You seem like you'd have interesting opinions. What's something you've been thinking about lately?"

**Why it works:** Creates a reason to respond; invites conversation.

### Light and Playful Openers

**When her profile has humor or lightness:**

> "Okay, I have to know—[playful question about something in her profile]?"

> "Your profile made me actually laugh (rare on here). [Reference to the funny thing]."

> "I'm taking a chance that you're as fun to talk to as your profile suggests."

**Why it works:** Matches her energy; feels enjoyable rather than obligatory.

### Observation-Based Openers

**Notice something interesting:**

> "I noticed you said [thing]. I feel the same way—it's surprisingly rare to find someone who gets that."

> "Something about your profile feels refreshingly genuine. It made me want to actually message rather than just swipe."

> "You have the best [photos/bio/answer to prompts] I've seen today. [Specific compliment on what makes it good]."

**Why it works:** Shows attention; compliments something meaningful.

## Examples by Profile Type

### If Her Profile Is Detailed

**Rich profile = easy conversation starters:**

> "You've clearly put thought into your profile, and it shows. I'd love to hear more about [specific interest she mentioned]."

> "Between [interest 1] and [interest 2], we might actually have things to talk about. What's the story behind [one of them]?"

### If Her Profile Is Minimal

**Less to work with = get creative:**

> "Your profile is mysterious—makes me curious what you're actually like. What brought you to Feeld?"

> "I'm working with limited information here, but something made me want to message anyway. What's something about you that would surprise me?"

### If She Mentions ENM/Poly

**Acknowledge shared context:**

> "Fellow poly person here. Always curious how others are navigating it—what's been your experience on Feeld?"

> "I noticed you're ENM—how long have you been exploring that? I'm always interested in different paths people take."

### If She Has Kink Interests Listed

**Respectful acknowledgment:**

> "I noticed we have some overlapping interests. I'm curious about your experience with [general category she mentioned]—have you been exploring for a while?"

> "Your interests caught my attention. I'd love to hear more about what draws you to [thing] when you're comfortable sharing."

**Note:** Don't open with graphic sexual questions even if her profile is explicit about desires.

## What Not to Do

### The "Hey" and Variations

❌ "Hey"
❌ "Hi there"
❌ "How's your day going?"
❌ "What's up"

These require no effort and she's received hundreds of them. They give her nothing to respond to.

### Immediate Sexual Comments

❌ "You're sexy"
❌ "I'd love to do [sexual thing] to you"
❌ "What are you into in bed?"

Even on an explicitly sex-positive app, leading with sexual comments comes across as seeing her as an object, not a person.

### Negging or Backhanded Compliments

❌ "You're cute for someone into [thing]"
❌ "Not the usual type I go for but..."
❌ "You'd be prettier if you smiled"

This manipulation tactic is widely recognized and universally disliked.

### The Novel

❌ [800-word message about your entire life story]

Too long, too much pressure, too difficult to respond to. Keep it conversational.

### Copy-Paste Obvious

❌ Messages that clearly could have been sent to anyone

She can tell. Personalization matters.

### Demanding Attention

❌ "Why haven't you responded?"
❌ "Hello??? Are you there?"
❌ Multiple follow-ups to no response

If she doesn't respond, move on.

## Structuring Your Message

### The Formula

**Element 1:** Hook (something that catches attention)
**Element 2:** Connection point (reference to her profile)
**Element 3:** Question or invitation (easy way to respond)

### Example Breakdown

> "I don't usually message first, but something about your profile pulled me in [hook]. That photo from Iceland is stunning—I've been dying to go there [connection point]. What was your trip like? [question]"

### Length Sweet Spot

- Not too short (shows no effort)
- Not too long (creates pressure)
- 2-4 sentences is usually ideal
- Easy to respond to

---

## After She Responds

### Keep the Conversation Going

- Build on what she says
- Share about yourself proportionally
- Ask follow-up questions
- Move toward a clear direction (meeting up, exchanging numbers)

### Don't Get Stuck in Endless Chat

Some conversations need to move forward:

> "I've really enjoyed chatting with you. Would you want to continue this conversation over coffee sometime?"

### Read Her Signals

- Enthusiastic responses = she's interested, keep going
- Short or delayed responses = she might be busy or less interested
- No response = move on

## FAQ

**How long should I wait before messaging after matching?**
Within a day or two is good. Too fast seems eager; too slow loses momentum.

**What if she doesn't respond to a good opener?**
Move on. She might be busy, overwhelmed, or not interested. Don't send follow-ups unless days have passed and you want to try once more.

**Should I comment on her appearance?**
If you do, make it respectful and not the main point. Better to compliment something in her profile or photos that isn't just physical.

**What if we have nothing in common based on her profile?**
Then you might not be a good match. Or ask what she's looking for—sometimes there's more beneath the surface.
