## FAQ

**What if I'm not a great conversationalist?**
Ask questions, be genuine, and practice. Most people appreciate effort over perfection.

**How much should I share about myself?**
Balance is key. Share enough to be interesting, don't dominate. Answer questions plus a little extra.

**What if we match but I change my mind?**
It's okay. A simple "I don't think we're a match" or just unmatching is fine. Don't lead people on.

**Is it okay to be talking to multiple people?**
Yes, that's expected on dating apps. Just be honest if asked and give each conversation genuine attention.
