## Setting Up Your Profile for Kink + Poly

### The Desire Tags

Feeld offers desire tags. Use them strategically:

**Kink-relevant tags:**
- BDSM
- Bondage
- Dominance
- Submission
- Kink
- Various specific interests

**Poly-relevant tags:**
- Polyamory
- Open relationship
- ENM
- Relationship anarchist

**Select what's genuinely relevant**—not every possible interest.

### Writing Your Bio

**Include:**
- Your relationship structure
- Your kink orientation (dom/sub/switch/etc.)
- What you're looking for
- Any critical boundaries or must-haves

**Example bio:**
> "Poly, partnered, dating separately. Switch leaning submissive, interested in power exchange dynamics. Looking for connection with kinky, ethically non-monogamous people. Happy to discuss more—let's start with conversation."

### Photos

**For kink:**
- Hints are fine; explicit usually isn't
- Save the revealing stuff for later
- Show personality first
- Consider photos from events (munches, etc.)

**General rules:**
- Clear face photo (at least one)
- Multiple photos
- Show interests beyond kink/dating

## Finding Kinky Poly People

### Using the Filters

**Set preferences for:**

## First Conversations

### Opening Messages

**Balance kink and connection:**
> "Hey! I noticed we share some kink interests and you mentioned being poly. I'd love to chat and see if we connect. What brought you to Feeld?"

**Not just about kink:**
> ~~"I see you're a sub. I'm a Dom looking for..."~~
> ✓ "Your profile mentions [non-kink interest]. I'm also into that. And it seems like we might have compatible kink interests too..."

### When to Discuss Kink

**Not immediately:**
- Establish some rapport first
- Show you see them as a person
- Let kink come up naturally
- Or ask when it feels right

**How to bring it up:**
> "I noticed we both listed [kink interest]. What does that look like for you?"

> "At some point I'd love to talk about what we're each into. When feels right for that?"

### Negotiation Conversations

Before any play, discuss:
- Experience levels
- Specific interests and limits
- Boundaries and safewords
- Communication preferences
- How kink fits with your poly structure

## Moving from Chat to Meet

### Vetting for Kink

Before meeting someone for potential kink:
- Longer conversation than vanilla dating
- More specific questions about experience
- References if possible (especially for play)
- Video call to verify and gauge

### First Meetings

**For kinky poly connections:**
- Meet vanilla first (coffee, public)
- Don't play on first meeting
- Establish rapport and trust
- Negotiate before any play

**What to discuss:**
- Detailed negotiation
- Boundaries and limits
- Safewords
- Communication preferences
- STI status and safer sex

## Safety for Kinky Poly People

### Vetting Matters More

Kink involves vulnerability. Take extra care:
- Community references (FetLife, events)
- Mutual connections
- Time to build trust
- Multiple vanilla interactions before play

### Red Flags Specific to Kink

Watch for:
- "Real doms/subs don't need safewords"
- Resistance to negotiation
- Pushing boundaries in conversation
- No community presence or references
- Too much too fast

### Trust Your Instincts

If something feels off, it probably is. Better to pass on a connection than end up in an unsafe situation.

## Using Feeld Alongside FetLife

### The Combination

Many kinky poly people use both:
- **Feeld:** Finding individuals to date
- **FetLife:** Community, events, vetting

### Cross-Platform Vetting

When you match on Feeld:
- Ask if they're on FetLife
- Check their profile and activity
- Look for mutual connections
- See if they attend events

### Moving Between Platforms

If a Feeld match is also on FetLife:
> "I'd love to see your FetLife profile if you're comfortable sharing. Mine is [name]. It helps me get a better sense of people."
