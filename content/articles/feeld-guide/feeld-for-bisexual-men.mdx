### Bio Approaches

**Direct and proud:**
> "Bi man, out and comfortable with it. Looking for genuine connections with people who appreciate all of who I am."

**Casual mention:**
> "Into hiking, cooking experiments, and connecting with interesting people of all genders. Bi and poly."

**Addressing it proactively:**
> "Yes, I'm bi. No, that doesn't mean I can't commit or that I'll cheat. Looking for someone who gets that."

### What You're Seeking

**Clarify:**
- Who you want to match with
- What kind of connections
- Your relationship structure
- What you're open to

**Settings:**
- Show to all genders (if seeking broadly)
- Or specific to what you want now
- Couple visibility as preferred

### With Men

**Challenges:**
- Gay men sometimes dismiss bi men
- Assumed to be closeted or confused
- May be seeking only certain things
- Different app dynamics than Grindr

**Making connections:**
- Many bi and gay men on Feeld

## Common Questions You'll Get

### "So you're really bi?"

**Response options:**
> "Yep, fully attracted to multiple genders. It's pretty simple actually."

Or:
> "Is that something you're asking because you have concerns, or just curiosity?"

### "Have you been with men/women?"

**Your choice to answer:**
> "I don't think my history is relevant to whether we connect, but yes, I've dated various genders."

Or:
> "That's pretty personal for a first conversation. What made you curious?"

### "Won't you miss men/women?"

**Addressing the assumption:**
> "Do you miss other women when you're dating one person? Same concept. Bi doesn't mean I need everyone."

### "Are you really looking for a relationship?"

**Countering the stereotype:**
> "Absolutely. Bisexuality is about who I'm attracted to, not how I date. I'm looking for something real."

## FAQ

**Should I mention being bi in my first message?**
Not necessarily, but don't hide it. If it's in your profile, they can see it. Bring it up naturally if it's relevant.

**Why do some women reject bi men?**
Biphobia exists, often rooted in stereotypes about cheating, AIDS, or masculinity. It's their issue, and you've filtered out someone incompatible.

**Is Feeld good for bi men?**
Better than many apps for visibility and community, though not without challenges. The ENM focus means more sexually open and often more bi-accepting users.

**How do I find bi-friendly partners?**
Look for inclusive language in profiles, queer identity markers, ENM experience, and positive responses when you mention being bi.
