If you're new to Feeld—or coming from apps like Tinder or Bumble—you might be confused by Feeld's terminology. What exactly does "connecting" mean? Is it the same as matching? What happens after you connect?

This guide explains Feeld's connection system clearly, so you know exactly what's happening and what to do next.

---

## Connecting = Matching

Let's clear up the main confusion right away:

**On Feeld, "connecting" is the same as "matching" on other apps.**

When Feeld says you've "connected" with someone, it means:
- You liked their profile
- They liked yours
- You can now message each other

It's the mutual interest confirmation, just with different vocabulary.

---

## How Connections Happen

### Step 1: You Discover a Profile
While browsing Discover, you see someone's profile.

### Step 2: You Like Them
You tap the heart to like their profile (or use a [Ping](/feeld-guide/feeld-ping-guide) to stand out).

### Step 3: They See Your Interest
Your like is now visible to them (depending on their subscription and settings):
- **Free users:** See you eventually in their feed and can like back
- **Majestic users:** Can see you in their "Liked You" section immediately

### Step 4: Mutual Interest = Connection
When they like you back, Feeld notifies both of you: "You're connected!"

### Step 5: You Can Message
You now have access to chat. Either person can send the first message.

---

## What Happens When You Connect

### You Get Notified
Feeld sends a notification (if enabled) letting you know about the new connection.

### They Appear in Connections Tab
The profile moves from discovery to your Connections section, where you can access it anytime.

### Chat Opens
You can start a conversation. There's no time limit or rules about who messages first.

### Profile Info Remains Visible
You can still see their full profile, photos, bio, Desires, and Interests.

## Connections vs. Likes: The One-Way vs. Two-Way Distinction

| Status | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **You liked them** | One-way interest; they may or may not have seen you yet |
| **They liked you** | One-way interest; you haven't responded yet |
| **Connected** | Mutual interest; both parties have liked each other |
| **Match** | Same as connected (other apps' terminology) |

Feeld sometimes uses "like" and "connection" interchangeably in the interface, which adds to confusion. Just remember: connection = mutual.

---

## What Connections Look Like in the App

### The Connections Tab
Your connections live in a dedicated section of the app. Here you'll find:
- Everyone you've mutually liked
- Ongoing conversations
- Connections you haven't messaged yet

### New Connection Indicator
New connections typically have a badge or indicator showing you haven't chatted yet.

### Conversation History
Once you start messaging, the connection becomes a conversation thread you can return to anytime.

---

## After You Connect: What to Do

### Option 1: Message Them
Most connections fizzle because no one initiates. Don't wait—send a message. Even a simple one is better than silence.

**Quick tips:**
- Reference something from their profile
- Ask an open-ended question
- Be yourself, not generic

For specific opener ideas, see our [Feeld openers guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-openers).

### Option 2: Wait (But Understand the Risks)
You can wait for them to message first. But:
- They might be waiting too
- The connection may go stale
- Other matches might take priority

If you're genuinely interested, initiate.

### Option 3: Unmatch
If you connected accidentally or changed your mind, you can unmatch. They won't be notified, and the connection disappears.

## Why Connections Sometimes Feel Slow

Compared to faster-paced apps, Feeld connections often take longer to develop. Reasons include:

### Smaller User Base
Feeld has fewer users than Tinder or Hinge, meaning fewer potential connections overall—but often more intentional ones.

### More Intentional Users
People on Feeld tend to be pickier, reading profiles carefully before deciding. This means fewer connections but potentially higher quality.

### ENM Complexity
People in open relationships or exploring ENM often have more considerations before connecting—checking with partners, managing time, etc.

### Activity Patterns
Some users check the app less frequently than on mainstream apps. Your like might not be seen for days.

---

## Connection Expiration: Does It Exist?

**Feeld connections don't expire** like some apps (Bumble's 24-hour rule, for example).

Once you connect:
- The connection stays indefinitely
- Either person can message anytime
- There's no automatic unmatch

However, connections without any conversation may feel stale if you message weeks later. The other person might have forgotten about you or moved on.

---

## Connections Tab Organization

Your Connections tab may be organized by:
- Most recent activity
- Newest connections first
- Conversations vs. no message yet

Different app versions may display this differently. The key is that all your mutual interests live here.

---

## Couples and Connections

If you connect with a couple on Feeld:
- You're connected with their paired profile
- Both partners can see and respond to messages
- You might hear from one or both partners

For singles connecting with couples, or couples connecting with others, see our [Feeld for couples guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-for-couples).

---

## When Connections Disappear

Sometimes a connection vanishes. This means:

### They Unmatched You
They chose to disconnect. No notification is sent. The conversation disappears.

### They Deleted Their Account
If someone deletes their Feeld account, they disappear from your connections.

### They Got Banned/Removed
Feeld may remove profiles that violate terms of service.

### It's a Technical Issue
Rarely, connections can disappear due to bugs. If you suspect this, contact Feeld support.

## Making Connections Actually Count

Connecting is just the first step. Many connections never become conversations, and many conversations never become dates.

**What separates connections that go somewhere:**

1. **Quick initiation** - Message within 24-48 hours
2. **Personalized opener** - Show you read their profile
3. **Genuine curiosity** - Ask questions, show interest
4. **Clear intentions** - Don't dance around what you're looking for
5. **Responsive communication** - Reply within reasonable time

## Connections and Feeld Premium (Majestic)

Majestic affects connections in a few ways:

**See Who Liked You:** You can see people who liked you before deciding whether to like them back. This lets you prioritize connections with people already interested.

**Advanced Filters:** You can filter discovery to see only people likely to be compatible, increasing connection quality.

**More Pings:** Stand out in someone's feed to increase the chance they like you back.

For more on whether premium is worth it, see our [Feeld pricing guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-pricing).

## FAQ: Connecting on Feeld

### Can I see who I've liked but hasn't connected yet?
Not directly. Once you like someone, you'll either connect (they liked back) or they won't appear again.

### Can someone see that I liked them before they like me back?
Only if they have Majestic. Free users only see your profile in their feed; they don't know you've already liked them.

### Is there a limit to how many connections I can have?
There's no stated limit to active connections.

### Can I message someone before connecting?
No. Mutual connection (both liking each other) is required before messaging opens.

### What's the difference between connecting and pinging?
A ping is a way to send a like with a note, potentially standing out more. It can lead to a connection if they like you back. See our [Feeld ping guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-ping-guide) for details.
