Consent isn't just about the bedroom—it starts in your first message. On Feeld, how you communicate shows potential matches whether you'll respect them in person.

Here's how to message in ways that center consent from the start.

## What Consent-First Messaging Looks Like

### The Principles

**Ask, don't assume:**
- Don't presume someone is interested in something
- Check before going sexual
- Let them guide their comfort level

**Respect the answer:**
- Accept "no" without pushing
- Don't try to negotiate boundaries
- Continue respectfully regardless

**Be clear about intent:**
- Say what you're looking for
- Don't hide your desires
- Let them make informed decisions

**Create space for their voice:**
- Ask questions
- Pause for responses
- Don't dominate the conversation

## Opening Messages

### Good Consent-First Openers

**Reference their profile:**
> "I noticed you mentioned being into [interest]. I'd love to hear more about what that looks like for you—if you're up for chatting."

**Be clear about your interest:**
> "Your profile caught my attention, especially [specific thing]. I'm looking for [your intention]. Would you be open to getting to know each other?"

**Low pressure:**
> "Hi! I found your profile interesting and wanted to say hello. No pressure to respond, but I'd enjoy connecting if you're open to it."

### What Makes These Work

- Clear about intent without being presumptuous
- Give them easy out ("if you're open to it")
- Reference something specific (shows you read their profile)
- Not demanding their attention

### What to Avoid

**Presumptuous:**
> "So when are we meeting?"

**Demanding:**
> "Message me back."

**Generic with entitlement:**
> "Hey beautiful, I know you'll love what I have to offer."

## Moving to Desires and Interests

### When to Bring Up Sexual/Kink Topics

**Wait for signals:**
- They've indicated interest in you
- Conversation has established rapport
- Context feels right (not out of nowhere)

**Or they bring it up first:**
- Follow their lead
- Match their level of openness
- Still ask before sharing explicit content

### How to Ask About Interests

**Opening the conversation:**
> "I'd love to learn more about what you're looking for on here. What kinds of connections or experiences are you hoping for?"

**More specific inquiry (after rapport):**
> "Your profile mentions [desire]. I'm curious what that looks like for you—no pressure to share if you'd rather not."

**Before getting explicit:**
> "I'd like to talk more specifically about desires. Are you comfortable going there, or would you prefer to keep things lighter for now?"

### Asking Before Sending

**Before explicit messages:**
> "I'd love to share more about what I'm into, but I want to check first—are you open to more explicit conversation?"

**Before photos:**
> "Would you be interested in exchanging photos? Only if you're comfortable."

**Before detailed fantasies:**
> "I have some ideas about what we might enjoy together. Would you like to hear them, or would you rather discover that in person?"

## Responding to Their Desires

### When They Share

**Interested:**
> "That sounds really exciting. Tell me more about what that would look like for you."

**Curious but unsure:**
> "I haven't explored that much, but I'm curious. Can you help me understand what appeals to you about it?"

**Not your thing:**
> "That's not really something I'm into, but I appreciate you sharing. Is that a must-have for you, or is there flexibility?"

### What Not to Do

- Don't shame or judge what they share
- Don't pretend interest you don't have
- Don't go silent—acknowledge their vulnerability
- Don't immediately say "me too" if it's not true

## Setting and Respecting Boundaries

### Sharing Your Own Boundaries

**Be clear:**
> "I should mention that [boundary] is something I'm not open to. I wanted to be upfront about that."

**Frame positively:**
> "I'm really interested in [things you want] and prefer to keep things focused there."

**When asked about something you don't want:**
> "I appreciate you asking. That's not something I'm into, but I'd love to explore [alternative] instead."

### When They Set Boundaries

**The only appropriate response:**
> "Totally understand. Thank you for letting me know."

**Then actually move on:**
- Don't ask why
- Don't try to convince them
- Don't sulk or withdraw
- Continue the conversation normally

### Scripts for Respecting Limits

**They decline to share something:**
> "No problem at all. Happy to keep things where you're comfortable."

**They say no to meeting:**
> "That's fine! Let me know if you change your mind."

**They're not into something you mentioned:**
> "Good to know. What are you more interested in?"

## Checking In During Conversation

### Consent Is Ongoing

Don't just get one "yes" and assume forever:

**Periodic check-ins:**
> "How's this conversation feeling for you? Comfortable?"

**When things escalate:**
> "Is this level of conversation working for you?"

**When you're unsure:**
> "I want to make sure this is enjoyable for you too. Are you good with where this is going?"

### Reading Signals

**Signs they're engaged:**
- Asking questions back
- Sharing openly
- Enthusiastic responses
- Moving conversation forward

**Signs to check in:**
- Short responses suddenly
- Long delays
- Topic changes
- Less warmth

**When in doubt, ask:**
> "You seem quieter—everything okay? Happy to shift gears if this isn't working."

## When They Don't Practice Consent

### If They Push Boundaries

**First time:**
> "I mentioned I'm not comfortable with that. Please respect that."

**If they continue:**
> "I've said no to that twice now. I'm not going to continue this conversation."

**Then unmatch.** You don't owe more chances.

### If They Don't Ask Before

**If they send unsolicited explicit content:**
> "I didn't ask for this. In the future, please check before sending explicit content."

Or just unmatch without response.

**If they assume consent:**
> "I appreciate your interest, but I prefer to be asked before [thing]. Can we start over with that understanding?"
