## Why Screening Matters

### What You're Screening For

- Fake profiles / catfishing
- People misrepresenting their situation
- Boundary-pushers and predators
- Unicorn hunters (if you're avoiding them)
- People whose communication style doesn't fit yours
- Potential safety risks

### The Goal

Not paranoia—just smart assessment. Most people on Feeld are genuine. Screening helps you find them faster and avoid the ones who aren't.

## Profile Red Flags

### Visual Red Flags

🚩 **Only one photo**
- Could be fake or hiding something
- Ask for more before meeting

🚩 **All photos are professional/edited**
- May be catfishing
- Ask for casual photos

🚩 **Photos don't match** (different people, varying ages)
- Possible fake profile
- Reverse image search suspicious ones

🚩 **No face photos but requesting yours**
- Asymmetric privacy expectations
- Okay if explained, concerning if demanded

🚩 **Group photos only**
- Which person are they?
- Ask for clarification

### Bio Red Flags

🚩 **Empty bio**
- Low effort, possibly not serious
- May be hiding intentions

🚩 **"Ask me anything" type bios**
- Zero information to screen with
- Makes you do all the work

🚩 **Negativity-focused** ("no drama," "don't waste my time")
- Often indicates drama-prone people
- Hostility before you've even talked

🚩 **Overly sexual immediately** (depending on your goals)
- May only want hookups
- May not respect boundaries

🚩 **No mention of ENM/relationship structure**
- Are they actually non-monogamous?
- Are they cheating?

## Verification Steps

### Before Meeting

**Do:**
- Video chat first (verifies they look like photos)
- Exchange social media (shows a real life exists)
- Google their name + city (public info, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Reverse image search their photos
- Talk enough to get a feel for them

**Ask:**
- What are you looking for?
- What's your relationship situation?
- Does your partner know? (if they claim one)
- What does ENM look like for you?

### The Video Call Test

A short video call reveals:
- They look like their photos
- They can hold a conversation
- Their vibe matches messaging
- No major red flags in how they present

If someone refuses a video call before meeting, that's worth noting.

### Social Media Check

When you connect on social:
- Does their life look real?
- Is their relationship status consistent with what they told you?
- Do they have friends, history, normal human presence?
- Any red flags in how they interact publicly?

## Screening for Couples

### Verifying Couple Profiles

If matching with a couple:
- Is it both people or just one?
- Have you communicated with both?
- Are they both equally interested?
- Does the "other" partner actually exist and consent?

### Questions to Ask Couples

- "Will I be able to meet/video call both of you before we meet?"
- "Are you both equally interested, or is this more one person's interest?"
- "How long have you been practicing ENM?"
- "What does your ideal dynamic look like?"

### Unicorn Hunter Warning Signs

If you're avoiding unicorn hunters:
- "Looking for a third" language
- One person does all the talking
- Couples privilege isn't acknowledged
- "She's bi-curious" (experimenting on you)
- Strict rules about what you can/can't do

## First Meeting Safety

### Before You Go

- Tell a friend where you're going and who with
- Share your date's profile with someone
- Have your own transportation
- Meet in a public place
- Check in with someone during/after

### First Date Choices

**Good first date spots:**
- Coffee shops
- Bars (public area)
- Restaurants
- Parks (daytime, populated)

**Avoid for first meetings:**
- Their home
- Your home
- Isolated locations
- Anywhere you can't easily leave

### During the Date

Trust your gut:
- If something feels off, leave
- You don't owe them more time
- "I need to go" is a complete sentence
- Have an exit strategy ready

## The Screening Conversation

### Questions That Reveal Character

Low-pressure questions that show a lot:
- "What does ethical non-monogamy mean to you?"
- "How do you handle conflict?"
- "What's your relationship with your other partner(s) like?"
- "What happened in your last relationship/connection?"
- "What are you not looking for?"

### How They Respond Matters

Notice:
- Do they answer directly or evade?
- Do they get defensive at reasonable questions?
- Do they ask about you too?
- Are they curious or just selling themselves?

## When to Unmatch

### It's Okay to End It If:

- They push when you set a boundary
- Stories don't add up
- They refuse verification
- Your gut says something's wrong
- They're disrespectful
- They don't meet your basic standards

### You Don't Owe Anyone:

- An explanation
- A second chance
- The benefit of the doubt
- Your time or energy
