Feeld has multiple features designed to help you stand out and get more matches: Pings and Uplifts. If you're not sure which one to use—or what the difference even is—you're not alone.

This guide breaks down both features, compares their effectiveness, and helps you decide which one makes sense for your goals.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | What It Does | Cost | Best For |
|---------|-------------|------|----------|
| **Ping** | Sends a like with a personal note | Limited free, more with Majestic | Specific profiles you're very interested in |
| **Uplift** | Boosts your profile visibility | Majestic feature | Getting more overall visibility |

## What Is a Feeld Ping?

A Ping is an enhanced like that includes a short message. Instead of just heart-ing someone's profile, you can attach a note that they see before deciding whether to like you back.

### How Pings Work

1. You see a profile you're interested in
2. Instead of (or in addition to) liking, you tap the Ping option
3. You write a short message (there's a character limit)
4. They receive your ping with your message
5. They can respond, like you back, or pass

### Ping Limits

**Free users:** Get a limited number of pings (currently around 1 per day)

**Majestic subscribers:** Get more pings (typically 5+ per day)

### What Makes a Good Ping

Since you only have a short message and limited pings, make them count:

- Reference something specific from their profile
- Be genuine, not generic
- Show personality
- Ask an easy-to-answer question or make a comment that invites response

For detailed ping strategies, see our [complete Feeld ping guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-ping-guide).

## What Is a Feeld Uplift?

An Uplift (sometimes called a boost on other apps) temporarily increases your profile's visibility in other users' feeds.

### How Uplifts Work

1. You activate an Uplift
2. For a limited time (typically 30-60 minutes), your profile is shown to more people
3. You appear higher/earlier in discover feeds
4. More people see you = more chances for connections

### Uplift Availability

Uplifts are a **Majestic (premium) feature**. Free users don't have access to boosts.

Majestic subscribers typically get a limited number of Uplifts per month as part of their subscription.

## Key Differences: Ping vs. Uplift

### Targeting

**Ping:** Laser-focused on one specific profile you've already seen and want to connect with.

**Uplift:** Broad visibility boost—you're shown to more people, but you can't control who specifically.

### Effort

**Ping:** Requires you to write something thoughtful. More effort per use.

**Uplift:** One tap and you're boosted. Passive after activation.

### Message Opportunity

**Ping:** You can say something before you even match—a significant advantage.

**Uplift:** No message component. Just visibility.

### Cost Structure

**Ping:** Limited quantity for free; more with premium.

**Uplift:** Premium-only feature.

### When Results Arrive

**Ping:** Results depend on that specific person seeing and responding to your ping.

**Uplift:** Results come from increased overall traffic to your profile during the boost window.

## When to Use Pings

### You've Found Someone Really Interesting
Don't waste pings on profiles you're lukewarm about. Save them for people who genuinely stand out.

### Your Profile Alone Might Not Compete
If someone gets a lot of attention, a ping with a thoughtful note can differentiate you from a sea of simple likes.

### You Have Something Relevant to Say
The best pings reference something specific. If their profile gives you something to work with, that's a good ping candidate.

### You're Looking for Quality Over Quantity
Pings are about targeted effort. One great ping is worth more than five generic ones.

---

## When to Use Uplifts

### Your Profile Is Strong
Uplifts amplify whatever you already have. If your photos are great and your bio is compelling, more visibility = more connections. If your profile is weak, more people seeing it won't help.

### You're in a Competitive Area
In major cities with lots of users, your profile can get buried. Uplifts push you to the top temporarily.

### You Have Limited Swiping Time
If you can only use the app during certain windows, boosting during those times ensures you're seeing (and being seen by) active users.

### You Want Passive Results
Uplifts work while you're doing other things. Boost, then continue browsing or close the app—people will still see your elevated profile.

### Timing Is Strategic
Best times to Uplift:
- Weekend evenings (high app activity)
- Sunday afternoons
- Avoid very late night or early morning

## What Gets Better Results?

The honest answer: **it depends on your situation.**

### Pings Often Work Better For:
- Connecting with specific people you're excited about
- Standing out to higher-demand profiles
- Starting conversations before matching
- Quality-focused approach

### Uplifts Often Work Better For:
- Overall profile exposure
- Testing whether your profile appeals broadly
- Users in high-density areas
- Passive match acquisition

### The Combination Approach
Many successful users do both:
1. Use Uplifts to get more general visibility and attract likes
2. Use Pings strategically on profiles they really want to connect with

This covers both the passive and active sides of getting matches.

## Cost Considerations

If you're deciding based on value:

### Is Majestic Worth It for Pings?
If you find yourself constantly running out of free pings, Majestic's increased ping allotment can be valuable. But if you rarely use them all, it's not a selling point.

### Is Majestic Worth It for Uplifts?
Uplifts are nice but not game-changing for everyone. In smaller areas with fewer users, boosting doesn't help much—there just aren't more people to show you to.

For a complete breakdown of whether premium is worth it, see our [Feeld pricing guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-pricing) and [Feeld Majestic review](/feeld-guide/feeld-premium-worth-it).

## Common Mistakes

### Wasting Pings on Generic Messages
"Hey, you seem cool" is barely better than a regular like. If you're using a ping, make the message count.

### Uplifting a Weak Profile
Boosting visibility doesn't fix bad photos or an empty bio. More people seeing a weak profile = more passes, not more connections.

### Using Uplifts at Bad Times
Boosting at 3am when few people are on the app wastes the feature. Time your boosts for high-activity periods.

### Over-Relying on Either Feature
Neither pings nor uplifts substitute for a genuinely appealing profile. They're amplifiers, not replacements for quality.

---

## Alternative: Improve Your Profile First

Before spending effort or money on visibility features, make sure the basics are covered:

### Photos
Are they clear, recent, and showing your personality? Do you have at least 4-5 quality images?

### Bio
Does it communicate who you are and what you're looking for? Is there something to hook a reader?

### Desires
Are they accurate and specific? Do they help the algorithm show you to compatible people?

A great profile with no boosts will outperform a mediocre profile with constant boosting.

If you're not getting matches at all, see our [no matches diagnostic guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-no-matches-fix) before investing in visibility features.

## The Bottom Line

**Use Pings when:**
- You want to stand out to specific people
- You have something genuine to say
- You're prioritizing quality connections

**Use Uplifts when:**
- Your profile is strong and you want more eyes on it
- You're in a crowded area and need to compete
- You want passive match generation

**Use both when:**
- You have Majestic anyway
- You want maximum match potential
- You have limited time and need to optimize every session
