## First Date Principles

### Keep It Simple

**First date goals:**
- See if you enjoy each other's company
- Check for in-person chemistry
- Have a conversation
- Decide if you want to see each other again

**Not first date goals:**
- Impress them with elaborate plans
- Create pressure with high stakes
- Make it hard to leave if it's not working
- Spend a lot of money

### Make It Easy to Leave

**Good first dates:**
- Have a natural end point
- Don't trap either person
- Allow graceful exit if needed
- Can be extended if going well

### Public and Safe

**For first meeting:**
- Public location
- Familiar area (for at least one of you)
- Tell someone where you're going
- Have your own transportation

## Best First Date Ideas

### Coffee/Tea

**Why it works:**
- Low pressure
- Short time commitment
- Easy to extend or end
- Cheap
- Daytime option

**When to choose:**
- Very first meeting
- When you're both busy
- If either person is nervous
- For casual, low-stakes vibe

### Drinks

**Why it works:**
- Relaxed atmosphere
- Evening energy
- Conversation flows
- Easy to extend to dinner
- Natural end point (finishing drink)

**When to choose:**
- Both comfortable with alcohol
- Evening availability
- Looking for romantic vibe
- Want slightly more energy than coffee

### Walk/Activity

- Movement helps conversation flow
- Shows your area/interests
- Natural, low pressure
- Can be any length

**Ideas:**
- Walk in a park
- Browse a market
- Visit a museum
- Explore a neighborhood

### Food

**Cautions:**
- More commitment than drinks
- Harder to leave if not clicking
- More expensive
- Higher pressure

**When it works:**
- Both are foodies
- You've already video chatted
- Strong pre-date chemistry
- You're both clear it's a full date

## Planning Logistics

### Who Picks the Place?

**Taking the lead:**
- If you suggested the date, you can suggest the place
- "How about [specific place]?" is helpful
- "What do you want to do?" puts burden on them

**Collaborative approach:**
- "Do you prefer coffee or drinks?"
- "Any neighborhood that works better for you?"
- "I was thinking X, but open to suggestions"

### Choosing a Location

**Good choices:**
- Somewhere you know and like
- Convenient for at least one of you
- Appropriate noise level for conversation
- Not too crowded

**Avoid:**
- Places that are hard to find
- Very loud venues
- Spots where you'll run into everyone you know
- Anywhere that creates pressure

### Time and Duration

**First dates:**
- 1-2 hours is plenty
- Don't plan a whole evening
- Can always extend if going well
- Better to leave wanting more

**Timing:**
- Evening works for most
- Weekend afternoon for casual
- Lunch dates for busy schedules

## ENM-Specific Considerations

### Location Discretion

**If privacy matters:**
- Choose somewhere you won't run into colleagues
- Different neighborhood might help
- Consider what visibility you're comfortable with
- Discuss comfort level beforehand

### Partners' Knowledge

**If applicable:**
- Make sure your partner(s) know about the date
- Communicate timing and location
- Have agreements about checking in
- Don't create secrets

### Talking About ENM

**First date conversations:**
- They know you're ENM (Feeld context)
- But specifics might come up
- Be prepared to discuss your situation
- Don't hide or be cagey

---

## Pre-Date Communication

### Confirming the Date

**Day before:**
> "Looking forward to tomorrow! Still good for 7 at [place]?"

**Day of:**
> "See you tonight!"

### Exchange Numbers

**Before meeting:**
- Easier for day-of communication
- Can text if running late
- Feels more real than app messaging
- Both people should be comfortable

### Handling Changes

**If you need to adjust:**
- Communicate ASAP
- Offer alternatives immediately
- Don't just cancel without rescheduling (if you still want to meet)
- Be flexible if they need to adjust

---

## Day-of Preparation

### Physical Prep

**Basic self-care:**
- Shower, grooming, etc.
- Dress appropriately for venue
- Comfortable but effort-showing
- Smell good (not overwhelming)

### Mental Prep

**Mindset:**
- Lower the stakes mentally
- It's just a conversation
- They already agreed to meet—they're interested
- Worst case: you have one drink and leave

### Practical Prep

**Logistics:**
- Know how you're getting there
- Arrive on time (or a few minutes early)
- Have payment method
- Phone charged

---

## During the Date

### Arrival

**First moments:**
- Greeting: hug, handshake, whatever feels natural
- Comment on something positive
- "Great to finally meet you!"
- Get settled, order drinks/food

### Conversation

**Good approach:**
- Build on things you discussed online
- Ask questions, listen to answers
- Share about yourself
- Keep it balanced

**Avoid:**
- Interviewing them
- Only talking about yourself
- Complaining about dating apps
- Heavy topics too early

### Paying

**Options:**
- Split: fair and no obligation
- Offerer pays: "I invited you, I've got this"
- Alternate: you get this one, they get next (implies next)
- Be prepared either way

### Reading the Room

**Signs it's going well:**
- Conversation flows
- Both are engaged
- Time passes quickly
- Neither wants to leave

**Signs to end:**
- One-word answers
- Checking phone frequently
- Obvious disinterest
- Discomfort

---

## Ending the Date

### Natural Endings

**When ready to wrap up:**
- "This has been really nice"
- "I should probably head out"
- Graceful conclusion

### If You Want to See Them Again

**Make it clear:**
> "I've really enjoyed this. I'd love to do this again—are you free next week?"

**Or after leaving:**
> "Had a great time tonight. Would love to see you again."

### If You Don't Want to See Them Again

**Kind but clear:**
> "Thanks for meeting me. I don't think we're the right match, but I wish you well."

**Or, less directly:**
> "Thanks for the nice evening."
[Don't suggest another date or leave it ambiguous]

---

## After the Date

### The Follow-Up

**If you want to see them again:**
- Text within 24 hours
- Express interest clearly
- Suggest next date or ask when they're free

**If you don't:**
- You can send a polite "thanks for meeting"
- Or simply not follow up (if they're also not interested)
- If they ask, be honest

### Processing

**For yourself:**
- How did it feel?
- Do you want to see them again?
- Any concerns?
- What worked or didn't?

## FAQ

**Should we meet for the first date or video call first?**
Either is fine. Video call is a good middle ground if either person is nervous about meeting.

**How formal should the first date be?**
Casual is usually best. Low stakes allows you both to relax.

**What if they're different from their profile?**
It happens. Give it a chance unless something is seriously wrong or deceptive.

**Who should pay?**
Discuss it naturally or be prepared for either scenario. Splitting is always fair.
