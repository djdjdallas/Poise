Feeld boosts put your profile at the top of potential matches' feeds—but they're limited. Use them at the wrong time, and you've wasted a valuable resource.

Here's the data-backed strategy for maximizing your boosts.

## How Feeld Boosts Work

### What a Boost Does

When you activate a boost:

- Increased visibility for a limited time
- More potential matches see your profile

### Boost Duration

Feeld boosts typically last:
- 30 minutes of increased visibility
- The boost window is when timing matters most

## The Best Times to Boost

### Sunday Evening: The Sweet Spot

**Why Sunday evening works:**
- People planning their week
- Winding down, phone in hand
- Thinking about upcoming dates
- High app engagement
- Less competition from weekend activities

**Optimal window:** 7-10 PM local time on Sundays

### Weekday Evenings

**Tuesday through Thursday, 8-10 PM:**
- People home from work
- Active on apps during "couch time"
- Planning weekend dates
- Less competition than weekends

**Why mid-week:**
- Monday people are recovering from weekend
- Friday people are going out
- Mid-week is prime swiping time

### Late Night (With Caveats)

**10 PM - 12 AM can work:**
- Night owls are active
- Less competition from other boosters
- People in bed, scrolling
- More relaxed, open mindset

**Caveat:** This timing may select for people awake late—consider if that's your target.

### Avoid: Daytime on Workdays

**9 AM - 5 PM Monday-Friday:**
- People at work
- Less phone time
- Not in dating mindset
- Lower app engagement

Your boost is wasted on people who aren't looking.

### Looking for Dates This Weekend

## Timing Based on Your Market

### Urban Areas (High Volume)

**More competition means:**

### Suburban/Rural Areas (Lower Volume)

**Fewer users means:**
- Timing matters less (smaller pool)

- Test what works in your specific area
- Consider nearby city timing if close enough

### Age Demographics

**Younger users (20s-early 30s):**
- More active later at night
- Weekend nights can work well
- Higher late-night engagement

**Older users (35+):**
- Earlier evening often better
- Sunday evenings particularly strong
- Less late-night activity

### Ready to Respond?

**Be available during and after boost:**

- Capitalize on fresh matches

### Messaging Ready?

**Have openers prepared:**
- Ideas for conversation starters
- Questions to ask
- Willingness to put in effort
- Time to have actual conversations

## What to Do During Your Boost

### Active Swiping

**While boosted:**
- Be on the app swiping
- Mutual interest is more likely
- You'll see people seeing you
- Can match in real-time

### Don't Just Wait

**Passive boosting is less effective:**
- Active users get prioritized
- Swiping signals interest
- You can match immediately
- Waiting wastes the window

### Watch Your Match Feed

**Notice:**
- How many likes you're getting
- Quality of profiles matching
- If your boost is working
- Data for future timing decisions

---

## After Your Boost

### Immediate Follow-Up

**Within 24 hours:**
- Message new matches promptly
- Fresh matches are hot leads
- Don't let them go cold
- Quality messages, not just "hey"

### Analyze Results

**Track:**
- How many matches did you get?
- What time did you boost?
- How did it compare to previous boosts?
- Any patterns in who matched?

### Learn and Iterate

**For next time:**
- Did the timing work?
- Would earlier/later be better?
- What day seemed best?
- Adjust strategy accordingly

## Boost Strategies

### The Sunday Prime Time Strategy

**Weekly ritual:**
- Save boost for Sunday evening
- Profile optimized by Sunday afternoon
- Boost at 7-8 PM
- Active swiping during boost
- Message matches immediately after

### The Multi-Evening Strategy

**If you have multiple boosts:**
- Spread across different days
- Sunday + Wednesday, or
- Thursday + Sunday
- Compare results
- Double down on what works

### The Event-Based Strategy

**Boost around events:**
- Local kink events or parties
- ENM/poly meetups
- When relevant people are on the app
- Community activity increases visibility

## Common Boost Mistakes

### Boosting Without a Good Profile

**The problem:** More people seeing a bad profile = more rejections, not more matches.
**The fix:** Optimize profile BEFORE boosting.

### Boosting and Going Inactive

**The problem:** Getting matches but not messaging them wastes the boost investment.
**The fix:** Be ready to engage when you boost.

### Boosting at Random Times

**The problem:** Boosting at 2 PM on Tuesday reaches few active users.
**The fix:** Strategic timing based on app usage patterns.

### Boosting Too Often

**The problem:** Using boosts when regular activity would suffice depletes your limited supply.
**The fix:** Save boosts for when you need them (new area, after profile update, dry spell).

## FAQ

**Can I see when my boost is active?**
Yes, Feeld typically shows a timer or indicator during your active boost period.

**What if I boost and get no matches?**
Check your profile quality first. Also consider: your area may have low user volume, or you may need to adjust your desires/preferences.

**Should I boost in a new city before arriving?**
Yes, but give yourself 2-3 days lead time for conversations to develop before you arrive.

**Is Majestic worth it just for boosts?**
Depends on your market. In high-volume areas, boosts can be very effective. In low-volume areas, other features might be more valuable.
