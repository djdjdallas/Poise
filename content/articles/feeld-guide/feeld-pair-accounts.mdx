Feeld is one of the few dating apps designed with couples in mind. The pairing feature lets you link your profile with your partner's, showing you as a unit to potential matches.

But how exactly does pairing work? Is it better than separate profiles? This guide walks through everything couples need to know about connecting accounts on Feeld.

---

## What Is Account Pairing on Feeld?

Pairing links two individual Feeld profiles together. When paired:

- Both profiles appear connected to each other
- Potential matches can see you're a couple
- You can browse together or separately
- Your relationship status is transparent

Think of it as saying "we're together" without having to explain it in every conversation.

## How to Pair Your Feeld Accounts

### Step 1: Both Partners Create Accounts

Each person needs their own Feeld account first. You can't create a single shared account—pairing connects two separate profiles.

**What you need:**
- Each partner downloads the app
- Each creates a profile with their own photos and bio
- Each verifies their account (phone number, Apple ID, etc.)

### Step 2: Find the Pairing Option

Once both accounts exist:

1. Open Feeld and go to your profile settings
2. Look for "Pair with Partner" or "Connect Accounts"
3. The exact location varies by app version—check Settings or Profile sections

### Step 3: Send/Accept Pairing Request

**One partner initiates:**
1. Select the pairing option
2. Enter your partner's Feeld username or email
3. Send the pairing request

**Other partner accepts:**
1. They'll receive a notification or see the request in their settings
2. They review and accept
3. Accounts are now linked

### Step 4: Confirm Pairing

Once accepted:
- Both profiles show as paired
- A link to your partner's profile appears on yours
- Potential matches see your connected status

## Paired vs. Separate Profiles: The Options

Couples on Feeld have three main approaches:

### Option 1: Paired Profiles (Recommended for Most)

Both have individual profiles that are visibly linked.

**Pros:**
- Transparent about your relationship
- People can see both partners before connecting
- Builds trust—nothing hidden
- Each person maintains their own identity

**Cons:**
- Some singles avoid couples (their loss, honestly)
- Requires coordination between partners

### Option 2: Shared "Couples Profile"

Creating one profile that represents both of you together.

**Note:** Feeld is designed for individual profiles that pair, not joint accounts. Some couples work around this by one person creating an account and including both in photos/bio, but this isn't the intended use.

**Pros:**
- Simpler to manage (one account)
- Presents you as a unit from the start

**Cons:**
- Goes against Feeld's design philosophy
- Harder to show individual personalities
- Matches might not know who they're talking to
- May feel less authentic

### Option 3: Unpaired Separate Profiles

Both have individual profiles with no visible connection.

**Pros:**
- Maximum flexibility
- Can explore independently
- More privacy from each other's activity

**Cons:**
- Not transparent about relationship status
- Matches may feel misled when they learn you're coupled
- Can create awkward situations

## Which Approach Works Best?

For most couples exploring ENM or seeking thirds, **paired profiles** work best because:

1. **Transparency builds trust** - People appreciate knowing upfront
2. **Shows you're on the same page** - Pairing signals you're doing this together
3. **Avoids awkward reveals** - No "oh by the way I have a partner" moment
4. **Lets both personalities show** - Individual profiles with couple context

## What Paired Profiles Look Like to Others

When someone finds a paired profile in their discover feed:

### They See
- The profile of whoever appears in their feed
- A visible indicator that this person is paired
- A link to view the partner's profile
- Both people's photos and bios (if they click through)

### They Understand
- "This is a coupled person"
- "There's another person involved"
- "I can see both before deciding"

### How They Interact
- They can like/pass on the profile they see
- If curious about the partner, they can view their profile
- Matching typically means they're interested in both

---

## Pairing Settings and Privacy

### Who Controls What

Each partner maintains control over their own profile:
- Your photos
- Your bio
- Your Desires and Interests
- Who you like/pass on

What's shared is the connection itself—that you're together.

### Can You See Each Other's Activity?

Pairing doesn't give you access to your partner's:
- Swipes and likes
- Messages and conversations
- Profile views

You're connected, not surveilled. Each person's activity remains private.

### Unpairing

If you need to disconnect profiles:
1. Go to pairing settings
2. Select "Unpair" or "Disconnect"
3. Both profiles revert to individual status
4. Your existing matches and conversations remain

---

## Common Pairing Questions

### Can we have different preferences?

Yes. Each partner can set their own:
- Age range
- Distance
- Gender preferences
- Desires

You might match with different people based on individual settings.

### Do we both need Majestic?

Premium features apply per account. If one partner has Majestic and the other doesn't:
- The premium partner gets premium features on their account
- The free partner doesn't gain premium access
- Features don't transfer

For premium benefits, see our [Feeld pricing guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-pricing).

### What if my partner doesn't want to pair?

That's a conversation to have outside the app. Some considerations:
- Why don't they want to pair? Privacy? Independence? Something else?
- Are you aligned on how you want to present yourselves?
- Is unpaired exploration okay with both of you?

This is about relationship agreements more than app features.

### Can I pair with more than one person?

As of now, Feeld supports pairing between two accounts. Polycules with more than two might need to use bio text to explain their situation.

## Optimizing Your Paired Profiles

### Coordinate But Don't Clone

**Good:** Each profile has unique photos and personality while sharing compatible Desires.

**Bad:** Near-identical profiles that make you seem like one person split in two.

Show that you're together but still individuals.

### Reference Each Other Naturally

Your bio might mention:
- "Partner's profile linked—check us both out"
- "We're a package deal for certain adventures"
- A brief mention of what you're seeking together

Don't make your entire bio about your partner—you still need to represent yourself.

### Photos Together and Apart

Include:
- At least one photo of each of you solo (so people can tell you apart)
- Optionally, one photo together
- Photos showing your individual interests and personalities

A gallery of only couple photos makes it hard to know who's who.

### Make Your Desires Complement

If you're seeking shared experiences:
- Align on core Desires (e.g., both have "Threesome" if that's the goal)
- Differ on personal Desires that don't involve both of you
- Make sure nothing contradicts the couple message

For Desire strategy, see our [Feeld desires guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-desires-explained).

## After Pairing: What's Next?

Once you're paired and your profiles are set up:

### Browse Together or Separately

Some couples enjoy browsing together, discussing profiles. Others prefer to swipe independently and compare notes later. Find what works for you.

### Coordinate Conversations

When you match:
- Decide who initiates conversation
- Or have both reach out if they've liked both profiles
- Be consistent about how you communicate

### See Who Likes You (Majestic Feature)

With premium, you can see who's already interested. This helps couples find people who are into both of them.

## Troubleshooting Pairing Issues

### Can't Find Partner's Profile

- Make sure they've completed account setup
- Verify you have the correct username/email
- Ask them to check their account status

### Pairing Request Not Received

- Check spam/notification settings
- Try sending again
- Have partner look in their Feeld settings directly

### Want to Change Paired Partner

You'll need to:
1. Unpair from current partner
2. Complete that process
3. Pair with new partner

Feeld doesn't support instant switching—there's a disconnect then reconnect process.
