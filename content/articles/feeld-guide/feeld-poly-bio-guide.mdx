Writing a dating profile is hard enough. Writing one that communicates you're polyamorous—while attracting the right people and filtering out the wrong ones—is even harder.

Feeld is one of the best platforms for poly people, but your bio still needs to do heavy lifting. This guide shows you how to write a Feeld bio that clearly communicates your poly status, what you're looking for, and who you are as a person.

## What Your Poly Bio Needs to Accomplish

A good poly bio does several things at once:

1. **Establishes your relationship structure** - Are you solo poly, partnered, in a polycule?
2. **Clarifies what you're looking for** - Casual? Serious? Specific dynamics?
3. **Shows your personality** - Beyond just "I'm poly"
4. **Filters effectively** - Attracts compatible people, discourages mismatches
5. **Invites conversation** - Gives people something to respond to

That's a lot for a short bio. Let's break it down.

## The Essential Elements

### 1. Relationship Status/Structure

Be upfront about your current situation:

**Examples:**
- "Partnered and poly, dating independently"
- "Solo poly—no primary partner, not looking for one"
- "In a V, the hinge, looking for another connection"
- "Married, ENM for 3 years, wife has her own relationships"
- "Part of a triad, we date separately"

This saves everyone time. People who aren't compatible with your structure can move on.

### 2. What You're Seeking

Poly can mean many different things. Clarify what you actually want:

**Vague (less helpful):**
"Looking for connections"

**Specific (more helpful):**
"Looking for an ongoing FWB situation with someone who gets ENM"
"Seeking a potential girlfriend—I have capacity for something real"
"Open to casual or more, depending on chemistry"

### 3. Your Poly Style

How do you practice polyamory? This helps people understand compatibility:

- Kitchen table vs parallel
- Hierarchical vs non-hierarchical
- How involved partners are in each other's lives
- Any relevant boundaries or agreements

You don't need to list everything, but key details help.

### 4. You as a Person

Don't let polyamory be your entire identity. Include:
- Interests and hobbies
- What you're like to spend time with
- A conversation starter
- Something memorable

## Bio Structure That Works

Here's a template structure:

```
[Hook/personality opener - 1 sentence]

[Relationship structure - 1-2 sentences]

[What you're looking for - 1-2 sentences]

[Something interesting about you - 1-2 sentences]

[Conversation hook or call to action]
```

### Example Bio Using This Structure:

> Coffee snob who somehow ended up in a city with great coffee shops on every corner. Lucky me.
>
> Partnered for 5 years, practicing poly for 3. We date independently but are friends with each other's partners (when it works out that way).
>
> Looking for ongoing connections—somewhere between casual and committed. I have time for one more meaningful thing.
>
> Ask me about the weirdest coffee I've ever tried, or tell me about a book you couldn't put down.

---

## What to Include (And What to Save)

### Include in Your Bio:
- Basic relationship structure
- General seeking statement
- Personality/interests
- Conversation hooks

### Save for Conversation:
- Detailed boundaries and rules
- Your full relationship history
- Specific scheduling logistics
- Heavy processing or past drama

Your bio opens doors. Conversations build understanding.

## Common Poly Bio Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Leading with Labels Only

**Weak:**
> "Poly. ENM. She/her."

Labels tell people what you are, not who you are. Add personality.

### Mistake 2: The Disclaimer Dump

**Weak:**
> "Not looking for unicorn hunters. Not here for couples who haven't done the work. If you're going to be jealous, swipe left. No drama."

Negativity and defensiveness repel good matches too. State what you want, not what you don't.

### Mistake 3: Poly 101 in Your Bio

**Weak:**
> "Polyamory means loving multiple people. It's about honesty and communication. Cheating is NOT polyamory."

Feeld users know what poly is. You don't need to educate.

### Mistake 4: Forgetting Yourself

**Weak:**
> "Partnered, poly, looking for someone who respects boundaries and communicates well."

This says nothing about who you are. What makes you interesting to date?

### Mistake 5: Being Too Vague

**Weak:**
> "Just here to meet cool people and see what happens!"

This could be anyone. What specifically are you looking for? Who specifically are you?

## Bio Examples by Poly Style

### Solo Poly Bio

> Building a life I love with room for meaningful connections—but not looking for a primary or to move in with anyone.
>
> I'm the friend who always has a book recommendation and will absolutely drag you to that weird art thing. Freelance designer by day, amateur chef by night.
>
> Seeking people who have their own rich lives and want to add to each other's, not complete each other.

### Partnered Poly Bio

> Ten years married, three years poly. We date separately, meet metamours when it makes sense, and genuinely want each other to find good things.
>
> I'm looking for something ongoing with its own identity—not just "the other relationship." Could be a monthly dinner and sleepover, could grow into more. Chemistry dependent.
>
> Work in nonprofit land, decompress through hiking and trashy TV, make a mean breakfast burrito.

### Polycule Member Bio

> Part of a small polycule that's basically a group chat that sometimes has sleepovers. We're not looking to add as a group—I'm dating for myself.
>
> Seeking connection with someone who's comfortable with complexity. Bonus points if you have your own people who matter to you.
>
> I'm the one who plans the trips, keeps the plants alive, and always has snacks. Tell me something you're excited about lately.

## Addressing Common Concerns

### "Won't being upfront about poly limit my matches?"

Yes—and that's the point. You want matches who are compatible with your actual life. Hiding it just delays rejection.

### "How much should I mention my partner(s)?"

Enough to establish context, not so much that it dominates your profile. This is about you, dating.

### "Should I link to my partner's profile?"

If you're on Feeld as a paired account, yes—the pairing feature does this. If you're dating separately and unpaired, mentioning you're partnered is enough. See our [pairing accounts guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-pair-accounts).

### "What if I'm new to poly?"

You can say so: "New to ENM and learning as I go. Looking for patient, communicative people." Honesty attracts compatible matches.

## Optimizing for Feeld Specifically

### Use Your Desires Wisely
Your bio and [Desires](/feeld-guide/feeld-desires-explained) should complement each other. If your Desires say "Polyamory" and "Emotional connection," your bio should reflect that.

### Don't Duplicate
You don't need to write "poly" in your bio if it's already in your Desires. Use bio space for personality.

### Consider Your Audience
Feeld users are generally familiar with ENM. You can use terminology without excessive explanation. Save space for what makes you uniquely you.

---

## Testing Your Bio

### The Friend Test
Show your bio to a friend who knows you. Ask: "Does this sound like me?"

### The Stranger Test
Show it to someone who doesn't know you. Ask: "What kind of person do you picture? What would you talk to them about?"

### The Swipe Test
After a week with your new bio, are you getting better quality matches? If not, iterate.

## Beyond the Bio

Your bio sets the stage. But what you say in messages—and how you navigate the complexities of poly dating—determines whether connections develop.

Poise helps you write opening messages that acknowledge shared poly experiences, navigate scheduling conversations, and communicate authentically about relationship structure.
