## Profile Strategy

### Choosing Your Identity Display

**Options:**
- Non-binary as primary identity
- More specific (genderqueer, agender, etc.) if available
- Combination of terms
- Whatever feels right

**In your bio:**
- Expand on your identity if you want
- Clarify pronouns if helpful
- Explain what you're seeking
- Add context for those unfamiliar

### Bio Approaches

**Straightforward:**
> "Non-binary (they/them). Looking for connections with people who actually see me, not a version of me that fits their expectations."

**More detailed:**
> "They/them. I exist outside the binary—not 'woman-lite' or 'man-adjacent,' just me. Seeking genuine connection with people who get that."

**Casual:**
> "Coffee addict, amateur photographer, non-binary human. They/them pronouns. Let's talk about your latest obsession."

### Photos

**Considerations:**
- Present yourself authentically
- No obligation to look a certain way
- Show your personality and style
- What makes you feel like you

---

## Common Challenges

### The Binary Problem

**Issues you may face:**
- People seeking "women" or "men" only
- Assumptions based on presentation
- Being misread or misgendered
- Fitting into others' categories

**What helps:**
- Clear profile statement
- Finding genuinely NB-inclusive people
- Patience (unfortunately)
- Community support

### Misgendering

**On Feeld:**
- Some people don't read profiles
- Pronouns may be ignored
- Binary assumptions persist
- Can be exhausting

**How to handle:**
- Correct gently (if you have energy)
- Unmatch if it continues
- Don't feel obligated to educate
- Find people who get it right

### Fetishization

**Some people:**
- Seek non-binary people specifically in problematic ways
- Treat your identity as exotic
- Have assumptions about your body
- Objectify rather than appreciate

**Red flags:**
- Immediate focus on your gender/body
- "I've never been with a non-binary person"
- Treating you as a category, not a person
- Invasive questions early

### Limited Dating Pool

**Reality:**
- Fewer people specifically seeking NB folks
- Some exclude NB from preferences
- May see the same profiles repeatedly
- Location dependent

## Finding NB-Affirming Matches

### Who Tends to Be Affirming

**Look for:**
- Queer people broadly
- Others who are non-binary
- Trans people
- People with inclusive language in profiles
- ENM folks with queer awareness
- Anyone who mentions pronouns thoughtfully

### Green Flags in Profiles

**Positive signs:**
- "All genders" in seeking
- Pronouns listed
- Inclusive language
- Queer community involvement
- Trans/NB friendly statements

### Conversation Screening

**Early conversation signs:**
- Correct pronoun usage
- Treating you as an individual
- Not making NB the focus
- Respectful curiosity (if any questions)
- Normal conversation

## Navigating Conversations

### When to Correct Pronouns

**Options:**
- First instance: "Just a heads up, I use they/them."
- Casual correction: "It's they, actually—no worries!"
- In profile so it's clear

**If they keep misgendering:**
- One more reminder
- If continues, consider unmatching
- You don't owe infinite patience
- Respect is baseline

### Handling Invasive Questions

**Common questions:**
- "What's in your pants?"
- "Are you transitioning?"
- "What's your real name?"
- "But what were you born as?"

**Responses:**
> "That's pretty personal for this stage of conversation."

> "My gender is non-binary. That's what you need to know."

> "I'm happy to talk about [other topic], but I'm not going to discuss my body with someone I just met."

### Finding Genuine Interest

**Ask them:**
- "What interested you in my profile?"
- "What are you looking for on Feeld?"
- "Have you dated non-binary people before?"

**Good answers focus on you as a person, not your identity as a novelty.**

## FAQ

**Does Feeld actually have good non-binary options?**
Better than most mainstream apps. Non-binary is explicitly available, pronouns can be displayed, and the user base tends to be more aware.

**Why do people still misgender me despite my profile?**
Some people don't read profiles carefully. Others don't understand or care. It's their failure, not yours. Filter them out.

**Is it worth using Feeld as an NB person?**
If you're interested in ENM/poly, yes. The community tends to be more gender-aware than mainstream dating apps. For strictly monogamous dating, you might also want other apps.

**How do I find people who actually understand non-binary identity?**
Look for queer people, others who are trans/NB, and those with inclusive language. Quick screening in early conversation reveals a lot.
