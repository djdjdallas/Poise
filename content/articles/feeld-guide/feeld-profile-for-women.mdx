## The Women's Challenge on Feeld

### Volume vs. Quality

**The reality:**
- Women typically get more matches than men
- But many are low-quality (mass swipers)
- Inbox can be overwhelming
- Finding good matches in the noise is hard

### Your Goal

**Profile should:**
- Attract people genuinely compatible with you
- Filter out people who swipe on everyone
- Communicate clearly what you want
- Give genuine matches a reason to stand out

---

## Photo Strategy

### Quality Over Quantity

**What matters:**
- Clear, high-quality photos
- Photos that show who you actually are
- Authentic representation, not performance
- Variety that shows different sides of you

### What to Include

**Recommended mix:**
- 1-2 clear face photos (your actual face, not heavily filtered)
- 1 full body photo (so there are no surprises)
- 1-2 photos showing personality/interests
- 1 photo that could start a conversation

### What to Avoid

**Common mistakes:**
- All photos with heavy filters
- Every photo being hyper-glamorous
- Only showing one angle
- Photos that don't look like current you
- All photos in same outfit/location

### The "Real You" Approach

**Authenticity pays off:**
- People who like the real you are better matches
- Filters set up disappointment
- Natural photos attract people who appreciate you
- Confidence in your real appearance is attractive

## Bio Strategy

### Be Specific About What You Want

**Why specificity matters:**
- Filters people who don't match
- Attracts people who are what you're seeking
- Reduces time spent on wrong conversations
- Shows you know what you want

**Instead of:** "Looking to meet interesting people"
**Try:** "Looking for emotionally available connections that start with great conversation"

### State Your Situation Clearly

**Include:**
- Your relationship status
- What you're looking for (types of connections)
- Availability and constraints
- What's on and off the table

**Example:**
> "Partnered and dating separately. Looking for ongoing connections, not one-time things. I take things slow and value communication."

### Set Boundaries in Your Bio

**Boundary-setting that works:**
- Frame positively when possible
- Be clear without being hostile
- Don't apologize for your boundaries

**Example:**
> "I like getting to know someone before meeting. If you're looking for something immediate, we might not be the right match."

### Show Personality

**Beyond the basics:**
- What makes you, you?
- Interests that could spark conversation
- Sense of humor (if that's you)
- What you're passionate about

## Filtering for Quality

### Bio Filters

**Include statements that filter:**
- "Looking for people who read profiles"
- "Tell me something about yourself when you message"
- "Bonus points if you can reference something from my bio"

These help identify people who put in effort vs. mass swipers.

### Desire Selection

**Strategic desires:**
- Be accurate about what you want
- Don't list things you're not interested in just to seem open
- Use desires to communicate your style
- Consider what your desires communicate about you

### Incognito Mode

**Consider using incognito (Majestic feature):**
- You control who sees you
- Reduces overwhelming volume
- More intentional matching
- Worth considering if volume is the problem

## Handling Common Challenges

### Too Many Low-Effort Messages

**Prevention:**
- Bio that invites specific responses
- Stating you respond to effort
- Not responding to "hey" (training the market)

**Response:**
- Develop quick filtering criteria
- Don't feel obligated to respond to everyone
- Quality conversation over quantity

### Unsolicited Sexual Messages

**Prevention:**
- Clear bio about what you're looking for
- Stating your communication preferences
- Nothing prevents all of it, unfortunately

**Response:**
- Unmatch and move on
- Report if violating terms
- Don't engage with disrespectful messages

### Couple Requests When You're Not Interested

**Prevention:**
- State in bio if you're not interested in couples
- Clear about what you're seeking

**Response:**
- Polite decline or simply don't engage
- You don't owe explanation

### Pressure to Meet Quickly

**Prevention:**
- State your pace preference in bio
- "I like to get to know someone before meeting"

**Response:**
- Maintain your boundaries
- People who can't respect your pace aren't right matches

## ENM-Specific Tips

### If You're Partnered

**Clarity is key:**
- State your relationship status upfront
- What your partner knows/approves
- What you're looking for (separate from partner or together?)
- Link to partner's profile if applicable

### If You're Solo

**Consider mentioning:**
- That you're solo poly (if applicable)
- What that means for what you're seeking
- Any specific dynamics you're interested in
- Your availability

### Seeking Specific Dynamics

**Be clear about:**
- Whether you're looking for something specific (D/s, etc.)
- If kink is involved, how to approach that topic
- What you're open to vs. what you're specifically seeking

## Handling Attention Wisely

### You Don't Owe Anyone Your Time

**Remember:**
- Matching doesn't obligate you
- You can unmatch for any reason
- Not responding to poor messages is valid
- Your time and energy are limited

### Developing Efficient Filtering

**Quick assessment:**
- Did they read my profile?
- Is there effort in their message?
- Does their profile show compatibility?
- Does anything feel off?

### Saying No

**It's okay to:**
- Not respond to messages that don't meet your standards
- Unmatch without explanation
- Decline to meet if you change your mind
- Block if needed

---

## Safety Considerations

### Profile Privacy

**Think about:**
- What information your photos reveal
- Whether your workplace/home is identifiable
- Username that doesn't connect to other accounts
- What a determined person could find

### Meeting Safety

**Always:**
- Meet in public first
- Tell someone where you're going
- Have your own transportation
- Trust your gut

## Example Bio Elements

### Opening Hook

> "Plant mom, podcast addict, always planning my next adventure. Looking for connection that starts with good conversation."

### What You're Looking For

> "Seeking ongoing connections with people who value communication. I like taking things slow—if that's your style too, we might be a good match."

### Personality Hint

> "Most likely to: suggest a bookstore date, ask about your relationship with your parents, stay up too late talking about ideas."

### Boundary Setting

> "I appreciate people who read profiles. If you message me, tell me something about yourself or what caught your attention."

## FAQ

**How do I get fewer but better matches?**
Be more specific about what you want. Use features like incognito mode. Don't swipe right on everyone.

**Should I mention I'm picky?**
Better to frame positively (what you do want) rather than negatively (you're picky). But clarity about standards is fine.

**How do I handle the volume?**
Develop filtering criteria. Don't feel obligated to respond to everyone. Quality over quantity.

**What if I'm not getting matches I like?**
Consider whether your profile is attracting the right people. What does it communicate? Who would it appeal to?
