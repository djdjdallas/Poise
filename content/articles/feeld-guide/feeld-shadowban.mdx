Your matches have suddenly stopped. Conversations aren't happening. You're swiping into the void. Something feels wrong, but there's no notification telling you what.

Welcome to the shadowban question—here's how to figure out what's happening and what to do.

## What Is a Shadowban?

### The Definition

A shadowban is when an app limits your visibility without telling you. Your account still works—you can log in, swipe, message—but other users rarely or never see your profile.

### Why Apps Do This

Shadowbans typically happen when:
- The app suspects rule violations
- Reports have been made against your account
- Automated systems flag your behavior
- You've done something against terms of service

### The Problem

Unlike a regular ban, you don't know it's happened. Everything looks normal from your side—except nothing is working.

## Signs You Might Be Shadowbanned

### Sudden Match Drought

**The pattern:**
- You were getting matches, then suddenly stopped
- Change happened abruptly, not gradually
- Swiping produces zero results for days
- No explanation or notification

**Note:** Match rates naturally fluctuate. A shadowban is more likely if the change was dramatic and sudden.

### Messages Going Nowhere

**Signs:**
- Existing matches stop responding all at once
- New matches never message back
- Conversations die simultaneously
- Even high-interest matches ghost

### Testing With Friends

**How to check:**
- Have a friend on Feeld search for your profile
- If they can't find you (and should be able to), that's a sign
- Note: Feeld doesn't have direct search, so this requires them swiping in your area

### Profile Views Disappeared

If you had profile views or other engagement metrics that went to zero suddenly, something may have changed with your visibility.

## What Can Trigger a Shadowban

### Reports From Other Users

**Common report reasons:**
- Inappropriate first messages
- Not being who you claim (catfishing suspicion)
- Harassment or boundary violations
- Spam-like behavior
- Photos that violate guidelines

**The threshold:** Usually multiple reports, not just one, trigger action.

### Terms of Service Violations

**Things that violate Feeld's terms:**
- Being under 18
- Soliciting prostitution
- Selling services (pro domme, content creator promotion)
- Hate speech or discrimination
- Non-consensual content references

### Algorithmic Flags

**Automated triggers might include:**
- Swiping patterns that look bot-like (too fast, too uniform)
- Copy-paste messages to many users
- Account creation from flagged IP addresses
- Rapid account cycling

### Photo Issues

**Photos that can cause problems:**
- Nudity in main photos (different from private photos)
- Images that look like they're not you
- Stock photos or obvious fakes
- Photos with other people's faces uncropped

## How to Confirm (Or Rule Out) a Shadowban

### Step 1: Rule Out Normal Fluctuation

**Ask yourself:**
- Has it been more than a week with zero matches?
- Did the change happen suddenly?
- Is this dramatically different from your normal rate?

If yes to all three, proceed.

### Step 2: Check Your Account Health

**Look for:**
- Any warning messages you might have missed
- Ability to use all features normally
- Whether your profile looks right to you
- Any unusual restrictions

### Step 3: Test Visibility

**Options:**
- Ask a friend to look for you (have them swipe extensively in your area)
- Create a new account to see if the experience is different (note: this can be against ToS)
- Check if you appear in Feeld's discovery features

### Step 4: Contact Support

**Why this helps:**
- They can tell you if there's an issue with your account
- You may get information about reports or flags
- They can sometimes restore visibility

## What to Do If You're Shadowbanned

### Option 1: Wait It Out

**Sometimes shadowbans are temporary:**
- Time-limited restrictions may lift automatically
- Algorithm adjustments can take time
- Your visibility might return without action

**Downside:** Could be waiting indefinitely with no guarantee.

### Option 2: Contact Feeld Support

**How to approach:**
- Be polite and non-accusatory
- Ask if there are any issues with your account
- Request information about any reports
- Ask what you can do to improve your standing

**Template:**
> "Hi, I've noticed a sudden and significant drop in matches and visibility on the app. I want to make sure my account is in good standing and understand if there's anything I should address. Can you let me know if there are any issues or flags on my account? Thank you."

### Option 3: Review and Improve Your Profile

**Make changes:**
- Update photos (remove anything borderline)
- Revise bio (remove anything that could be misread)
- Check all settings are appropriate
- Ensure your profile is complete

Sometimes making significant profile changes can reset algorithmic assessments.

### Option 4: Account Reset

**As a last resort:**
- Delete your account completely
- Wait at least two weeks
- Create a new account with different photos
- Use different email/phone

**Warnings:**
- This may violate terms of service
- Feeld may have device fingerprinting
- New accounts sometimes have initial boosts that make them feel artificially better
- The underlying issue may repeat if not addressed

## Preventing Shadowbans

### Messaging Behavior

**Do:**
- Personalize messages
- Respect non-responses
- Match the energy you receive
- Keep first messages appropriate

**Don't:**
- Copy-paste the same opener
- Send explicit content unrequested
- Message repeatedly without response
- Get aggressive when rejected

### Profile Practices

**Keep your profile:**
- Honest and accurate
- Within photo guidelines
- Free of commercial solicitation
- Respectful and inclusive

### Swiping Patterns

**Natural swiping:**
- Take time to read profiles
- Don't swipe right on everyone
- Don't swipe for hours continuously
- Be selective

**Suspicious swiping:**
- Right-swiping everyone rapidly
- Swiping hundreds of profiles in minutes
- Uniform patterns that look automated

### Reporting Others Appropriately

Ironically, making false reports against others can flag your own account. Only report genuine violations.

## When It's Not a Shadowban

### Normal Dry Spells

**Things that cause legitimate match drops:**
- You've swiped through available local users
- Seasonal changes (holidays, summer travel)
- Algorithm rotation showing you to different people
- Market saturation in your area

### Profile Issues

**Sometimes the problem is your profile:**
- Bad photos
- Off-putting bio
- Unclear about what you want
- Misaligned desires settings

### App Technical Issues

**Non-shadowban problems:**
- Bugs in the app
- Server issues
- GPS not working properly
- Outdated app version

## FAQ

**How long do Feeld shadowbans last?**
It varies. Some are permanent, some lift after weeks or months. Contact support for account-specific information.

**Can I get unshadowbanned?**
Possibly. Contacting support, making profile changes, or waiting it out sometimes works. A fresh account (after proper deletion) is a more reliable reset but has its own risks.

**Will Feeld tell me if I'm shadowbanned?**
Typically no. That's why they're called shadowbans. Support may give you limited information if you ask.

**Does using a VPN cause shadowbans?**
It can contribute. VPNs can flag your account as suspicious, especially if your location seems to jump around.
