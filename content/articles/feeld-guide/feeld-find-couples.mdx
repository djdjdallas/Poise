Couple-to-couple connections are one of Feeld's strengths, but finding compatible pairs and approaching them well requires some finesse. Whether you're looking for friendship, swinging, or polyamorous connections with another couple, this guide covers how to do it respectfully.

## Why Couple-to-Couple Dating Is Different

Dating another couple adds complexity:

- **Four people need chemistry** (at minimum)
- **Schedules are harder** - Coordinating two couples
- **Dynamics vary** - Swapping, group, parallel, or V connections
- **Communication multiplies** - More people, more conversations
- **Stakes feel higher** - More people affected if things go wrong

This complexity is why approaching it thoughtfully matters.

## Setting Up Your Profile for Couple-Matching

### Desires to Select

**For finding couples:**
- Couples (signals you're interested in pairs)
- Threesome or Group play (if applicable)
- Open relationship
- Whatever dynamic Desires apply to you

### Profile Setup

**Both partners need profiles:**
- Each person creates an individual profile
- Link them using Feeld's pairing feature
- Both should be complete and compelling

**Show you're a unit:**
- At least one photo together
- Mention your partner/relationship in bio
- Make clear you're seeking couples

**Example bio snippet:**

> Together 6 years, exploring ENM for 2. Looking to connect with other couples for... well, let's see what kind of connection develops. Open to anything from new friends who get it to something more adventurous.

## Finding Couples on Feeld

### Using Discovery Settings

Feeld lets you filter what you see:
- Look for profiles that mention being coupled
- Watch for linked/paired profiles
- Use Desires filtering if you have Majestic

### What to Look For

**Signs of a good couple match:**
- Both partners have complete profiles
- They're clearly paired (linked accounts)
- Their bios mention what they're seeking
- Photos show both people clearly
- They seem genuinely interested in this (not just one partner's idea)

### Red Flags to Watch

- Only one partner seems engaged
- Profiles that feel like one person wrote both
- Vague about what they want
- Pushy or overly sexual immediately
- Something feels "off" about their dynamic

## Approaching Other Couples

### First Contact: Don't Be Creepy

**Creepy approach:**
> Hey you two are hot 🔥 Want to swap? 😈

**Better approach:**
> Hi! We noticed you're also in [city] and into [shared interest]. We're [names], together for [X years] and enjoying meeting other couples. Would love to chat if you're interested!

### What Makes a Good Opener

- Introduce yourselves (both names)
- Reference something from their profile
- Be clear but not graphic
- Leave room for them to respond
- Don't assume they're interested in anything specific

### Who Should Message?

Options:
- One person reaches out, mentioning their partner
- Coordinate so one account sends the initial message
- Don't have both partners message separately (confusing)

Be clear early that you're a couple reaching out.

## The Getting-to-Know-You Phase

### Early Conversation Goals

Establish:
- What each couple is looking for
- Experience level with couple-dating
- What kind of connection interests everyone
- Logistics (schedules, location, etc.)
- Whether there's mutual interest worth pursuing

### Good Questions to Ask

- "What brought you two to Feeld?"
- "What does an ideal couple-connection look like for you?"
- "Have you connected with other couples before?"
- "What are you both hoping for?"

### Transition to Group Chat

At some point, all four people need to communicate:
- Suggest moving to a group chat
- Make sure everyone's voice is included
- Watch for signs one partner isn't as engaged

## Types of Couple-Couple Connections

### Social/Friendship

**What it is:** Making friends with another couple who understands ENM

**Why it works:** Community matters. Having couple friends who "get it" is valuable.

**How to approach:** Focus on shared interests, suggest low-pressure hangouts

### Soft Swap / Flirty Friends

**What it is:** Connection with some physical elements, but not full partner exchange

**Why it works:** Lower stakes way to explore chemistry

**How to approach:** Be clear about boundaries and what "soft" means to you

### Full Swap / Swinging

**What it is:** Sexual connections with partner exchange

**Why it works:** If everyone's attracted and interested

**How to approach:** Clear communication about expectations, boundaries, safer sex

### Polyamorous Connections

**What it is:** Romantic/emotional connections, not just physical

**Why it works:** When genuine connection develops beyond play

**How to approach:** Slower pace, individual relationships alongside group dynamic

### Mixed Connections

**What it is:** Maybe three people connect but not the fourth, or connections develop differently

**Why it works:** When you're flexible about how things develop

**How to approach:** Open communication, no forcing equal dynamics

## The First Meeting

### Planning the Meet

**Good first meeting ideas:**
- Drinks at a chill bar
- Dinner somewhere comfortable
- Activity you all enjoy (bowling, trivia, etc.)
- Something that allows conversation

**Not ideal for first meeting:**
- Your house or theirs (too much pressure)
- Somewhere overly sexual
- Anything with no exit strategy

### During the Meeting

- Relax—it's just humans meeting humans
- Talk to both people, not just one
- Watch group dynamics
- Don't force chemistry
- It's okay if the vibe isn't there

### After the Meeting

Debrief with your partner:
- What did you each think?
- Was there chemistry?
- Do you want to see them again?
- Any concerns?

If interested, follow up. If not, a polite "we had fun but didn't feel the spark" is fine.

## Navigating Four-Person Dynamics

### The "One Person Isn't Into It" Problem

Sometimes three people click but one doesn't. Options:
- Acknowledge it openly
- Explore whether connections can still work
- Accept it might not be the right match
- Don't pressure anyone to perform interest

### Unequal Attraction

Chemistry rarely lines up perfectly. Managing this:
- Communicate about it honestly
- Don't force equal connections
- Decide together what's workable
- Respect everyone's boundaries

### Scheduling Reality

Coordinating four adults is hard:
- Be patient with logistics
- Use shared calendars if it helps
- Accept that meetups may be less frequent
- Quality over quantity

---

## Communication Rules

### With Your Partner

- Debrief after interactions
- Share feelings openly
- Address jealousy or concerns early
- Make decisions together

### With the Other Couple

- Clear, direct communication
- Include everyone in important conversations
- Don't assume—ask
- Be honest about interests and boundaries

### About Boundaries

Before things get physical:
- What's everyone comfortable with?
- What's off the table?
- How will you check in during?
- What happens if someone wants to stop?

---

## Building Lasting Couple Friendships

The best couple connections often become:
- Ongoing friends you actually like
- People who understand your relationship style
- Community that supports your ENM journey
- (Sometimes) recurring fun connections

Treat other couples like humans you might actually want in your life, not just potential play partners.
