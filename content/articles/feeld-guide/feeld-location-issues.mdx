## Basic Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check Location Permissions

**On iOS:**
1. Go to Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services
2. Find Feeld in the list
3. Set to "While Using the App" or "Always"
4. Make sure "Precise Location" is ON

**On Android:**
1. Go to Settings → Apps → Feeld
2. Tap Permissions → Location
3. Set to "Allow only while using the app" or "Allow all the time"
4. Enable "Use precise location"

**Common permission issues:**
- Set to "Never" = Feeld can't see your location
- Precise location off = only approximate location used
- Changed permissions and forgot

### Step 2: Force Close and Reopen

**Simple restart:**
1. Close Feeld completely (not just minimize)
2. Wait a few seconds
3. Reopen the app
4. Check if location updated

**How to force close:**
- iOS: Swipe up from bottom, swipe Feeld away
- Android: Use recent apps, swipe Feeld away

### Step 3: Refresh Location in App

**Within Feeld:**
1. Go to your profile settings
2. Look for location options
3. Manually refresh or update location
4. Some versions have "Update my location" button

### Step 4: Log Out and Back In

**Account refresh:**
1. Log out of Feeld
2. Close the app completely
3. Wait a minute
4. Reopen and log back in
5. Check location

This forces the app to re-fetch your location data.

### Step 5: Reinstall the App

**If nothing else works:**
1. Delete Feeld from your phone
2. Restart your phone
3. Reinstall Feeld from App Store/Play Store
4. Log back in
5. Grant location permissions when prompted

## Specific Issue Solutions

### "No People Nearby" When There Should Be

**If you're in a populated area:**

1. **Check your distance filter**
   - Increase the maximum distance
   - Some areas need wider radius
   - Try maximum distance to see if anyone appears

2. **Check your age range**
   - Very narrow ranges limit results
   - Expand to see if profiles appear

3. **Check your desires**
   - Very specific desires may limit matches
   - Try broadening temporarily

4. **Check incognito mode**
   - If you're in incognito, you see fewer people
   - Regular mode shows full selection

5. **You may have swiped through everyone**
   - Small market areas run out of profiles
   - Wait for new users
   - Consider expanding distance

### Location Stuck on Previous City

**After moving or traveling:**

1. **Ensure GPS is working**
   - Open another app that uses location (Maps)
   - Verify your phone knows where you are
   - If GPS is wrong everywhere, it's a phone issue

2. **Clear app cache (Android)**
   - Settings → Apps → Feeld → Storage → Clear Cache
   - This doesn't delete your account

3. **Wait for location to propagate**
   - Sometimes takes time to update
   - Walk around to trigger GPS updates
   - Open the app in new location and leave it open

4. **Check for travel/passport mode**
   - If you used location-change features, reset them
   - Make sure you're set to current location, not pinned elsewhere

### Distance Calculations Seem Wrong

**When distances don't make sense:**

1. **Understand how Feeld calculates distance**
   - Uses location at time of last app open
   - May not be real-time
   - Their location vs your location at different times

2. **The other person may have moved**
   - They were far away when they last used the app
   - Now they're closer (or you're closer to them)
   - Distance is based on last known locations

3. **Approximate locations**
   - Without precise location, distance is estimated
   - Can be off by miles
   - Enable precise location for both people

## Phone-Level Fixes

### Verify GPS Is Working

**Test with Maps:**
1. Open Google Maps or Apple Maps
2. See if it shows your correct location
3. If Maps is wrong, the problem is your GPS, not Feeld

**Fix GPS issues:**
- Go outside (buildings block GPS)
- Turn GPS off and back on
- Restart phone
- Check for system updates

### Check for Battery Optimization

**Android battery settings:**
- Some battery savers restrict GPS
- Settings → Battery → App battery usage → Feeld
- Set to "Unrestricted" or "No restrictions"

**iOS Low Power Mode:**
- Low Power Mode can affect location accuracy
- Try with Low Power Mode off

### Update Your Phone

**System updates:**
- GPS improvements come in updates
- Make sure your phone's OS is current
- Outdated systems have more bugs

### Check VPN Status

**VPNs can affect location:**
- VPNs may make you appear elsewhere
- Turn off VPN while using Feeld
- Location services may conflict with VPN

## FAQ

**Why does Feeld need my location?**
Feeld uses location to show you nearby people and show your profile to potential matches in your area. Without accurate location, the app can't function properly.

**Can I fake my location on Feeld?**
Technically possible with GPS spoofing apps, but this violates terms of service, can get you banned, and is generally not recommended. It's also ethically questionable to misrepresent where you are.

**Why do I see people hundreds of miles away?**
Either your location is wrong, their location is wrong, your distance filter is set very high, or you've swiped through everyone nearby.

**Does Feeld update location automatically?**
The app updates location periodically when you use it, but may not update in the background. Open the app to trigger a location refresh.
