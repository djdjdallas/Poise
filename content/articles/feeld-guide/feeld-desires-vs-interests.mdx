# Feeld Desires vs. Interests: What's the Difference?

When you set up your Feeld profile, you'll encounter two separate sections: Desires and Interests. At first glance, they might seem similar—both are tags you select to tell potential matches something about yourself. But they serve fundamentally different purposes, and understanding the distinction can significantly improve your matching experience.

This guide breaks down exactly what Desires and Interests mean on Feeld, how to choose them strategically, and how to use both sections to attract the connections you're actually looking for.

---

## The Basic Distinction

Let's start with the fundamental difference:

**Desires** = What you're looking for in intimate/romantic connections
**Interests** = What you enjoy doing in your daily life (hobbies, passions)

Think of it this way: Desires answer "What are you seeking from connections on this app?" while Interests answer "Who are you as a person outside the bedroom?"

Both matter for compatibility, but they serve different filtering and matching functions.

## Understanding Desires

Desires on Feeld are the intimate, romantic, and sexual aspects of what you're seeking. They're the heart of why you're on Feeld rather than a mainstream dating app.

### What Desires Include

Feeld's Desire tags typically cover:

**Relationship Structures:**
- Monogamy
- Non-monogamy
- Polyamory
- Open relationship
- Relationship anarchy

**Connection Types:**
- Casual
- Friends with benefits
- Something ongoing
- Serious relationship
- Life partner

**Experience-Based:**
- Threesomes
- Group experiences
- Couples dating
- Being a third

**Orientation/Identity:**
- Heteroflexible
- Homoflexible
- Pansexual
- Demisexual
- Sapiosexual

**Kink Categories:**
- BDSM
- Power dynamics
- Exhibitionism
- Voyeurism
- Specific practices

### How Desires Affect Matching

Feeld uses Desires to influence who you see and who sees you. When your Desires align with another user's, you're more likely to appear in each other's feeds. Mismatched Desires can mean missed connections—or connections that don't go anywhere.

**Example:** If you select "Casual" as a Desire and someone else selects "Life partner," Feeld may deprioritize showing you to each other, recognizing the potential incompatibility.

### Strategic Desire Selection

**Be Honest, Not Aspirational**

Select Desires that reflect what you're actually looking for right now—not what you think might be interesting someday or what sounds good on paper.

If you're new to kink, selecting every BDSM-related Desire will attract experienced people looking for experienced partners. You'll waste their time and feel in over your head.

**Cast the Right Net**

Too few Desires means fewer potential matches. Too many Desires means matches that aren't aligned. Find the balance:

- Select your primary Desires (the non-negotiables)
- Add secondary Desires (things you're genuinely open to)
- Skip anything that's "maybe someday"

**Understand the Signals**

Some Desires send specific signals:

- "Casual" = not looking for emotional commitment
- "Something ongoing" = more than one-night stands
- "Life partner" = serious, committed intentions

Choose based on what you want people to understand about your intentions.

## Understanding Interests

Interests on Feeld are your hobbies, passions, and personality markers—the things that make up your life outside of romantic/sexual connection.

### What Interests Include

Feeld's Interest tags typically cover:

**Activities:**
- Hiking
- Yoga
- Cycling
- Dancing
- Gaming

**Cultural:**
- Live music
- Art
- Theater
- Film
- Reading

**Lifestyle:**
- Travel
- Cooking
- Wine/cocktails
- Cannabis
- Fitness

**Intellectual:**
- Philosophy
- Science
- Psychology
- Spirituality
- Politics

**Social:**
- Parties
- Festivals
- Board games
- Dinner parties

### Why Interests Matter

Interests serve several functions:

**Conversation Starters**
When someone messages you, shared Interests give them something to talk about. "I see you're into ceramics—I just started throwing last year" is a lot better than "hey."

**Compatibility Indicators**
Beyond intimate compatibility, you probably want to actually enjoy spending time with people you connect with. Shared Interests suggest compatible lifestyles.

**Personality Windows**
Your Interests tell a story about who you are. Someone who lists "hiking, meditation, gardening" paints a different picture than someone who lists "clubbing, cocktails, fashion."

**Filtering Beyond the Bedroom**
Two people might have perfectly aligned Desires but nothing to talk about. Interests help you find people you'll enjoy even when you're not being intimate.

### Strategic Interest Selection

**Be Specific**

"Music" tells people almost nothing. "Jazz vinyl collecting" tells them something specific they can connect with.

If Feeld only offers broad categories, use your bio to add specificity.

**Reflect Your Reality**

Don't select Interests you wish you had. If you haven't been hiking in three years, don't list hiking. You'll end up on dates where you're exposed.

**Show Range**

A mix of Interests paints a fuller picture:
- Something active (cycling)
- Something creative (photography)
- Something social (dinner parties)
- Something contemplative (reading)

This shows you're a dimensional person with a real life.

**Consider What Matters for Compatibility**

Some Interests are more compatibility-relevant than others:

- Cannabis use might matter for lifestyle alignment
- Festival culture signals specific social preferences
- Fitness levels might affect shared activities

Think about which Interests actually matter for the connections you're seeking.

## How They Work Together

The most effective Feeld profiles use Desires and Interests in harmony. Here's how:

### Desires Set Expectations

Your Desires tell someone: "This is the kind of connection I'm looking for. Are we aligned?"

If they're not aligned on Desires, matching Interests won't save the connection. You might have great conversations about shared hobbies, but if one person wants casual and the other wants commitment, it's not going anywhere.

### Interests Build Connection

Once Desires establish basic compatibility, Interests determine whether you'll actually enjoy each other's company.

You might find someone whose Desires perfectly match yours, but if you have zero Interests in common, dates might feel flat. You're compatible on paper but not in practice.

### The Ideal Match

The best Feeld connections often have:
- Aligned core Desires (you want similar things)
- Some overlapping Interests (you have things to do and talk about)
- Some different Interests (you can introduce each other to new things)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Treating Them as Interchangeable

Some people fill out one section thoroughly and ignore the other. This creates an incomplete picture and limits your matching potential.

**Fix:** Give equal attention to both sections.

### Mistake 2: Selecting Everything

If you select every Desire and Interest available, you're essentially selecting nothing. You're not helping anyone understand who you are or what you want.

**Fix:** Be selective. Choose tags that are genuinely true and important.

### Mistake 3: Conflicting Signals

Sometimes people's Desires don't match their bio, or their Interests seem inconsistent with their photos. This creates confusion.

**Example:** Selecting "Casual only" as a Desire but writing in your bio about wanting a deep, meaningful connection.

**Fix:** Ensure Desires, Interests, bio, and photos tell a consistent story.

### Mistake 4: Never Updating

Your Desires and Interests can change over time. What you wanted when you joined Feeld might not be what you want now.

**Fix:** Review and update periodically, especially after significant life changes or shifts in what you're seeking.

### Mistake 5: Using Desires as a Wishlist

Some people use Desires to list everything they might ever be interested in, rather than what they're actively seeking.

**Fix:** Focus on current, active Desires. You can always add more as you explore.

## How to Review Your Current Selections

If you've already filled out your profile, here's how to audit it:

### Step 1: Review Your Desires

- Are they accurate to what you want right now?
- Are any outdated or aspirational rather than real?
- Are you missing any core Desires?
- Do they tell a clear story about what you're seeking?

### Step 2: Review Your Interests

- Do they reflect your actual life?
- Would you be comfortable talking about all of them?
- Do they give someone conversation starters?
- Do they paint a picture of who you are?

### Step 3: Check for Consistency

- Do your Desires and Interests align with your bio?
- Do your photos support the story your tags tell?
- Would someone get a clear picture of who you are?

### Step 4: Get Feedback

If you have friends who use Feeld or understand the platform, ask them to review your profile. Sometimes others spot inconsistencies we miss.

## Advanced Strategy: Using Tags for Filtering

Beyond what tags mean to others, they also affect who Feeld shows you. Here's how to use that strategically:

### Narrow When You're Overwhelmed

If you're getting too many connections that don't align, make your Desires more specific. Fewer tags means more targeted matching.

### Broaden When You're Curious

If you're open to exploring, add Desires you're genuinely curious about. You might discover connections you wouldn't have found otherwise.

### Use Interests for Search

Some users search by specific Interests. Having detailed Interests makes you findable to people specifically looking for partners with shared hobbies.

---

## The Bigger Picture

Desires and Interests aren't just about gaming the algorithm or attracting more matches. They're about clarity and communication.

The clearer you are about what you want (Desires) and who you are (Interests), the more likely you are to find connections that actually work. Vagueness might seem like it keeps options open, but it usually just creates mismatched expectations.

Be honest, be specific, and trust that the right people will be attracted to the real you—Desires, Interests, and all.
