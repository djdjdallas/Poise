In monogamy, defining the relationship usually means one question: "Are we exclusive?" In polyamory, it's more complicated. What does "defining the relationship" even mean when multiple relationships are possible?

Here's how to navigate the DTR conversation in ENM.

## What "Defining the Relationship" Means in ENM

### Not the Same as Monogamy

In monogamy, DTR often means:
- Are we dating exclusively?
- Are we boyfriend/girlfriend?
- Is this going somewhere?

In ENM, the questions are different:
- What are we to each other?
- How does this relationship fit into our lives?
- What can we expect from each other?
- What words do we use?

### What You're Actually Defining

**Possible topics:**
- What to call each other (partner, boyfriend/girlfriend, friend, lover, etc.)
- Where this relationship sits in your life structure
- What expectations come with this connection
- What this relationship means to both of you
- How integrated your lives will be
- What's on the table (romance, sex, partnership, etc.)

## When to Have the Conversation

### Too Early

**Signs it's too soon:**
- You've only been on a few dates
- There isn't enough foundation to define
- You're trying to lock something down from insecurity
- Neither person has enough information to know what they want

**Too-early conversations often:**
- Create pressure
- Get vague answers because people genuinely don't know yet
- Feel forced

### Too Late

**Signs you've waited too long:**
- One person has been operating under assumptions that don't match reality
- There's growing uncertainty that's creating anxiety
- You're avoiding a conversation you both need
- Misaligned expectations have caused hurt

**Waiting too long risks:**
- Growing in different directions without realizing
- Building on a foundation of different assumptions
- One person feeling strung along

### The Right Time

**Good indicators:**
- You've spent enough time together to have feelings and opinions
- There's genuine curiosity about where this is going
- Questions are arising naturally (for one or both people)
- The relationship is developing and needs some navigation

**The right time feels like:** A natural progression, not a forced milestone.

## ENM-Specific DTR Questions

### Questions About Labels

**What to explore:**
- What do you want to call this?
- How do you introduce me to others?
- What words feel right for our connection?
- What labels matter to you?

**ENM-specific considerations:**
- Labels mean different things in poly contexts
- "Partner" can range from casual to life partner
- Some people avoid labels; others find them important
- Your other partners may affect how you define this one

### Questions About Structure

**What to explore:**
- Where does this relationship fit in your life structure?
- Is this a primary partnership, or something different?
- How much time and energy are available for this connection?
- What does this relationship have potential to become?

**ENM-specific considerations:**
- Some people practice hierarchy; others don't
- "Secondary" means different things to different people
- Available bandwidth matters
- Other relationships affect this one

### Questions About Expectations

**What to explore:**
- What can we expect from each other?
- How much communication? How much time?
- What commitments are we making?
- What's off the table?

**ENM-specific considerations:**
- Expectations vary widely across relationship types
- Clear expectations prevent resentment
- Your capacity may be limited by other commitments
- Different relationships can have different expectations

### Questions About Future

**What to explore:**
- What do you see happening with us?
- Is this something that might grow, or is it defined as what it is?
- What are your hopes for this connection?
- What would you not want this to become?

**ENM-specific considerations:**
- Not all relationships need to escalate
- Some connections are complete as they are
- Multiple relationships can have different trajectories
- The "relationship escalator" is optional

## How to Have the Conversation

### Starting the Conversation

**Direct approach:**
> "I'd like to talk about what we are to each other. I've been thinking about it and I'm curious where your head is."

**Soft approach:**
> "I've been enjoying our time together. I'm curious what you see happening between us?"

**Specific approach:**
> "Someone asked me about you and I didn't know what to say. Can we talk about how we describe this?"

### Sharing Your Perspective

**Lead with your position:**
> "Here's where I am: I really like spending time with you, and I'd like this to be a more defined relationship. What do you think?"

**But stay open:**
> "I have some thoughts, but I want to hear where you are too before I share everything."

### Asking About Theirs

**Open questions:**
> "How do you think about us?"
> "What does this relationship feel like to you?"
> "What would you want from a defined connection with me?"

**Listen fully before responding.**

### Finding Alignment

**If you're aligned:**
> "It sounds like we want similar things. Let's talk about what that looks like specifically."

**If you're not:**
> "It sounds like we're in different places with this. Can we talk about what that means?"

## Common DTR Scenarios in ENM

### Scenario 1: Becoming Partners

**Situation:** You've been dating casually and want more.

**The conversation:**
> "I've really valued our connection. I'm interested in being more intentional—calling you my partner, having you be a real part of my life. How would you feel about that?"

### Scenario 2: Clarifying Status

**Situation:** You've been seeing each other regularly but haven't named it.

**The conversation:**
> "We've been spending a lot of time together and I realize I'm not sure what to call us. What feels right to you?"

### Scenario 3: Addressing Assumptions

**Situation:** You're worried you're on different pages.

**The conversation:**
> "I want to make sure we're aligned on what this is. I've been thinking of us as [your assumption]. Is that how you see it too?"

### Scenario 4: Resisting Definition

**Situation:** They or you don't want to define things.

**The conversation (if you're the one resisting):**
> "I understand the desire to define this. I'm not ready for that conversation yet because [reason]. Can we revisit in [timeframe]?"

**The conversation (if they're resisting):**
> "I'd like some clarity on what we are. If you're not sure or not ready, that's okay—but I need to know that we'll get there eventually."

## What If You Want Different Things?

### Misaligned Definitions

**Common misalignments:**
- One wants partnership; one wants casual
- One wants more time; one has no more bandwidth
- One wants labels; one avoids them
- One sees potential; one sees a ceiling

### Navigating Differences

**Options:**
1. **Compromise:** Find a middle ground that works for both
2. **Adjust expectations:** Accept the relationship for what it is
3. **Wait and see:** Give it more time before deciding
4. **End it:** If needs are too different, part ways

**The key:** Honesty about what each person actually wants, not what they think they should want.

## After Defining

### What Changes

**When you've defined the relationship:**
- Clearer expectations
- Labels to use with others
- Shared understanding of what this is
- Foundation for addressing future questions

### What Stays the Same

**Defining doesn't mean:**
- Everything is figured out forever
- No more conversations needed
- The relationship is locked in place
- Nothing can change

**Relationships continue to evolve.** Definitions can too.

### Revisiting

**Plan to check in:**
- "Let's revisit this in a few months to see how it's working."
- "If anything changes for either of us, let's talk."
- "This is our starting point, not our forever answer."

## FAQ

**What if they don't want to define things?**
Some people genuinely need more time; others avoid definition as a pattern. Ask for a timeline: "When would you be ready to talk about this?"

**How is DTR different with multiple partners?**
Each relationship deserves its own definition. Don't assume one relationship's definition applies to another.

**What if defining creates hierarchy I don't want?**
You can define without hierarchy. "Partner" doesn't have to mean more important than other partners.

**What if I don't know what I want?**
Say that honestly. "I'm still figuring out what I want from this. Can we keep exploring and revisit?"
