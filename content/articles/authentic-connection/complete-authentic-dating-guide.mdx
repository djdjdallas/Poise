## Part 1: Why Authenticity Matters

- Allows you to be truly known
- Builds real intimacy

### The Paradox

**It seems:**
- Performing should work better
- Being yourself is risky
- Vulnerability might backfire

**Reality:**
- Authenticity is actually more attractive
- Real connection requires real you
- The "risk" filters for compatibility
