## FAQ

**What if I'm not naturally a deep conversationalist?**
Practice helps. Start with questions, follow threads, and listen well. You don't have to be philosophical—just curious and genuine.

**How do I get someone else to open up?**
Model openness yourself. Create safety through non-judgment. Ask good questions. But you can't force someone who doesn't want to.

**What topics should I avoid early on?**
Less about topic, more about approach. Heavy topics can work if handled with care. Read the situation and person.

**How do I know if we're connecting or just talking?**
Connection feels mutual, energizing, and alive. You're both engaged and invested. Just talking feels one-sided or empty.
