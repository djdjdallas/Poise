## What "Be Yourself" Actually Means

### Not Your Best Self—Your Real Self

**Being yourself isn't:**

- An optimized performance

**It is:**

- What you'd be like in a relationship

### Your Sustainable Self

**The version of you that:**
- You can maintain long-term
- Doesn't require constant effort
- Feels comfortable
- Is who you'd be in a relationship

## FAQ

**What if the "real me" isn't dateable?**
The real you is dateable to the right people. Trying to be someone else just delays finding them.

**How do I be myself when I'm nervous?**
Nervous is part of yourself. Acknowledge it, don't fight it. Authenticity includes the nervous parts.

**What if being myself means fewer matches?**
Maybe—but better matches. One compatible match beats 100 misaligned ones.

**How do I know if I'm being authentic?**
Ask: Would my close friends recognize this? Does this feel like effort or natural? Am I hiding or showing?
