ENM dating without regular reflection leads to burnout or autopilot. A weekly reset ritual helps you stay intentional, notice patterns, and maintain sustainable energy.

Here's a simple ritual that takes 20-30 minutes once a week.

---

## Why a Weekly Reset?

### The Problem with Continuous Dating

Without pauses to reflect:
- You repeat patterns without noticing
- Burnout sneaks up on you
- You lose sight of what you actually want
- Dating becomes reactive instead of intentional

### What a Reset Provides

- Space to notice how you're actually doing
- Opportunity to adjust your approach
- Clarity on where to focus energy
- Prevention of burnout before it hits

---

## The Reset Ritual

### Choose Your Time

Pick a consistent weekly slot:
- Sunday evening (prepare for the week)
- Friday evening (process the week)
- Any time that works regularly

Put it on your calendar. Protect it.

### The Environment

- Phone on silent (except for the reflection)
- Notebook or journal ready
- Comfortable space
- Maybe tea or something calming

---

## Part 1: Review (5-10 minutes)

### Check Your Data

Look at this week's dating activity:
- How many matches/conversations did you have?
- How many dates did you go on?
- How much time did you spend on apps?
- What were the outcomes?

### Check Your Feelings

Rate these 1-10:
- **Energy level** around dating: ___
- **Enthusiasm** for conversations: ___
- **Hopefulness** about connections: ___
- **Satisfaction** with how things went: ___

No judgment—just data.

### Notable Moments

Briefly note:
- Best conversation of the week
- Most draining interaction
- Any dates (how did they feel?)
- Any meaningful connections
- Any disappointments

---

## Part 2: Reflect (10-15 minutes)

### Patterns and Observations

Ask yourself:

**What's working?**
- Which conversations energized me?
- What approaches led to good results?
- What felt good this week?

**What isn't working?**
- Where did I waste energy?
- What drained me?
- What patterns am I repeating that aren't serving me?

**What did I learn?**
- About myself?
- About what I want?
- About how to date better?

### Deeper Questions

Pick one or two to sit with:

- "Am I dating toward something I want, or running from something I fear?"
- "If I met myself on an app this week, would I have been attracted?"
- "What would someone who loves themselves do differently?"
- "Am I treating the people I'm connecting with the way I want to be treated?"

### Energy Audit

Where did your dating energy go this week?

| Activity | Time Spent | Energy Cost | Value Gained |
|----------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Swiping | | | |
| Messaging | | | |
| Planning dates | | | |
| Actual dates | | | |
| Processing/thinking | | | |

Is the energy expenditure matching the value?

---

## Part 3: Reset (5-10 minutes)

### Clear the Deck

**App cleanup:**
- Unmatch conversations going nowhere
- Archive or delete old matches
- Clear notification backlog
- Close any loops that need closing

**Mental cleanup:**
- Let go of disappointments from this week
- Release expectations that didn't serve you
- Forgive yourself for any missteps
- Start fresh

### Set Intentions

For the coming week, decide:

**Quantity intentions:**
- How much time will you spend on apps?
- How many new conversations will you start?
- How many dates will you schedule?

**Quality intentions:**
- What approach will you take?
- What will you try differently?
- What will you stop doing?

**Energy intentions:**
- When will you engage with dating?
- When will you not?
- What boundaries will you maintain?

### Write One Commitment

End with a single, specific commitment:

> "This week, I commit to _______."

Examples:
- "...only swiping for 10 minutes twice per day"
- "...going on one date maximum and focusing on quality"
- "...responding within 24 hours to active conversations"
- "...unmatching anyone I'm not genuinely interested in"

---

## Part 4: Partner Check-In (If Applicable)

### If You Have ENM Partners

Include a brief partner check-in in your weekly ritual:

**Share:**
- How your dating life felt this week
- Any upcoming dates or developments
- Anything they should know

**Ask:**
- How are they feeling about their dating/your dating?
- Any needs or concerns?
- Anything to discuss?

**Align:**
- Any schedule coordination needed?
- Any boundary adjustments?
- Mutual support available?

### Keep It Brief

This isn't a deep processing session—just a weekly sync:
- 10-15 minutes maximum
- Same time each week
- Normalize the check-in

---

## Monthly Deep Dive

### Once a Month, Go Deeper

In addition to weekly resets, do a monthly reflection:

**The Big Picture:**
- How is dating fitting into my life overall?
- Am I moving toward what I want?
- What patterns have I noticed over the month?

**Adjustments:**
- Does my approach need significant changes?
- Do I need a break?
- Should I try something different?

**Gratitude:**
- What good came from dating this month?
- What connections am I grateful for?
- What did I learn about myself?

---

## Sample Reset Schedule

### Sunday Evening Ritual (30 min)

**6:00 PM - Review (10 min)**
- Check messages and matches
- Rate energy/enthusiasm
- Note highlights and lowlights

**6:10 PM - Reflect (10 min)**
- Journal on what worked/didn't
- Pick one deep question
- Do energy audit

**6:20 PM - Reset (10 min)**
- Clean up apps
- Set intentions
- Write commitment
- Partner check-in if applicable

### Making It Stick

- Same time every week
- Calendar reminder
- Comfortable environment
- Pair with something enjoyable (tea, music)
- Start simple, build over time

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I Keep Skipping It"

- Make it easier (shorter, simpler)
- Attach to existing habit
- Do it with a friend (compare notes)
- Reduce to 10 minutes if needed

### "It Feels Like More Work"

- Remember: 20 minutes weekly saves hours of wasted effort
- The reflection prevents burnout
- Think of it as maintenance, not extra work

### "I Don't Know What to Write"

Start with just:
1. Rate energy 1-10
2. One thing that worked
3. One thing that didn't
4. One intention for next week

Expand from there.

### "Nothing Changed This Week"

That's data too:
- Consistency can be good
- Or might mean autopilot
- Ask: "Is this what I want, or just what's happening?"
