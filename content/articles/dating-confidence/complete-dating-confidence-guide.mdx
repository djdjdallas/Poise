## FAQ

**Can you fake confidence until you have it?**
To some extent. Practicing confident behaviors can build real confidence. But authenticity matters—forced confidence often reads as arrogance.

**What if I've never been confident?**
Confidence can be built at any age. Start small, celebrate progress, and be patient. It's a skill, not a fixed trait.

**Doesn't confidence come from success?**
Some does, but foundational confidence comes from self-worth that isn't dependent on outcomes. Build from the inside out.

**How do I stay confident after rejection?**
Remember that rejection is about compatibility, not worth. Process, learn, and return to your foundation of self-value.
