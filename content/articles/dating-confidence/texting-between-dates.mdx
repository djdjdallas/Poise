You had a great date. Now what? How much should you text? What if they're texting more (or less) than you want? What if their other partners complicate things?

Here's how to navigate texting between dates in ENM.

## Why Texting Matters

### What Texting Does

**Between-date texting:**
- Maintains connection
- Shows continued interest
- Builds anticipation
- Creates conversational intimacy
- Signals investment level

### What It Doesn't Do

**Texting can't:**
- Replace in-person connection
- Compensate for incompatibility
- Fix relationship problems
- Create chemistry that isn't there

---

## ENM-Specific Texting Considerations

### Multiple Text Threads

**The reality:**
- You may be texting multiple people
- They're probably doing the same
- Bandwidth matters
- Response times vary

### Partner Time Affects Availability

**Practical factors:**
- They may be less available when with other partners
- You might be too
- This is normal, not a red flag
- Communication helps

### Different Relationships, Different Texting

**Varying patterns:**
- Long-term partner: different texting pattern than new connection
- Casual connection: might text less
- Each relationship finds its own rhythm

---

## Finding Your Texting Rhythm

### Early Dating

**First few dates:**
- Some contact between dates is expected
- Check in after a date ("I had a great time")
- Light conversation to maintain connection
- Don't overdo it—you're still getting to know each other

### As Things Develop

**Established connection:**
- More frequent communication is normal
- Daily check-ins may develop
- Inside jokes and ongoing conversations
- Find what works for both of you

### Long-Term

**Established relationship:**
- Whatever rhythm you've developed
- May be less than early dating (NRE fades)
- Quality over quantity
- Don't confuse texting with connection

---

## How Much to Text

### The Goldilocks Zone

**Not too little:**
- Radio silence feels like disinterest
- Some contact shows you're thinking of them
- Don't go days without any contact (unless discussed)

**Not too much:**
- Overwhelming texts feel needy
- Leave some mystery
- Respect their other commitments
- Don't monopolize their attention

### Match Energy (Somewhat)

**Calibration:**
- Notice their texting style
- Meet somewhere in the middle
- Don't text 10x more than they do
- But don't play games by texting less

### Ask Directly

**Communication:**
> "What's your texting style between dates? I want to make sure we're on the same page about staying in touch."

## When They're With Other Partners

### Expectations

**Normal patterns:**
- Less responsive when on dates with others
- May not text at all during partner time
- Don't expect constant availability
- This is part of ENM

### What to Do

**Healthy approach:**
- Don't blow up their phone
- Send a message, wait for response
- Occupy yourself
- Trust they'll respond when they can

### What Not to Do

**Unhealthy patterns:**
- Multiple messages escalating in intensity
- Monitoring their online status
- Getting upset about response times
- Making them feel guilty for being present with others

### If You Need Something

**Emergency vs. regular:**
- True emergencies warrant interruption
- "Thinking of you" can wait
- Respect their compartmentalized attention
- You'll want the same courtesy

## Texting Style Differences

### If You're a Frequent Texter

**And they're not:**
- Don't assume they're not interested
- Ask about their style
- Find middle ground
- Don't flood them to force engagement

### If You're a Minimal Texter

**And they text more:**
- Don't leave them hanging
- Communicate your style
- Make effort to meet them partway
- They need some signal of continued interest

### When Styles Clash

**Having the conversation:**
> "I've noticed we have different texting styles. I'm more of a [your style] texter, and you seem to be [their style]. How can we find something that works for both of us?"

---

## What to Text About

### Good Between-Date Content

**Ideas:**
- Follow-ups on things discussed on the date
- Sharing something that reminded you of them
- Light, fun conversation
- Planning next date
- Checking in genuinely

### Avoid

**Not great for text:**
- Heavy emotional processing
- Relationship-defining conversations
- Conflict resolution
- Anything that needs tone and nuance

### Building Connection

**Effective texting:**
- "Just saw [thing related to their interest] and thought of you"
- "How did [thing they mentioned] go?"
- "This made me laugh—you'd appreciate it" [share meme/link]
- "Thinking about our conversation about [topic]"

---

## After a Date

### The Post-Date Text

**Timing:**
- Same day or next day
- Don't wait days (plays games)
- Don't text immediately from the parking lot (too eager)
- Within 24 hours is standard

**Content:**
> "I had a great time tonight. Looking forward to seeing you again."

> "Thanks for a fun evening! I'm still thinking about [specific moment]."

### If You Want to See Them Again

**Be clear:**
- Indicate interest in next date
- Don't leave them guessing
- Can suggest next date in same message or follow-up

### If You're Not Sure

**Honest approach:**
- Still thank them
- Take time to think
- Don't ghost—communicate decision when you've made it

---

## When Texting Gets Complicated

### If They're Not Responding

**Give it time:**
- 24-48 hours is reasonable before follow-up
- One follow-up is okay
- If still nothing, assume they're not interested
- Don't harass

### If Things Feel Off

**Trust your gut:**
- Are they engaged or giving one-word answers?
- Is conversation flowing or pulling teeth?
- Texting chemistry should exist (even if different from in-person)

### If You're Anxious

**Self-regulation:**
- Don't text from anxiety
- Wait until you're calm
- Don't demand reassurance through constant texting
- Use other support systems

---

## Texting Agreements

### Things to Discuss

**Possible agreements:**
- General response time expectations
- Whether you check in before/during/after their other dates
- How often you expect to hear from each other
- What warrants interruption vs. can wait

### Example Agreement

**What it might look like:**
> "Let's aim to text at least every other day. When one of us is on a date with someone else, a goodnight text is fine but no expectation of conversation. If something's urgent, we'll call."

---

## FAQ

**Should I text every day?**
Depends on the relationship and what you both want. Early dating might be less; established might be more. Discuss it.

**What if they take hours to respond?**
People have lives. Hours is normal. Days without any response is concerning. Patterns matter more than individual response times.

**Is it okay to double-text?**
Occasionally, yes. Repeatedly without response? No. One follow-up after a reasonable time is fine.

**Should I text them when they're with another partner?**
Light, low-pressure texts are usually fine. Demanding attention or conversation isn't. Know your agreements.
