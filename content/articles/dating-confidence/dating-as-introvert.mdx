## FAQ

**Do I need to date other introverts?**
Not necessarily. Some introverts thrive with extrovert partners who respect their nature. Others prefer fellow introverts. Know what works for you.

**How do I explain needing alone time without seeming uninterested?**
Be direct: "I really enjoy our time together. I also need alone time to recharge—it's not about you, it's how I'm wired."

**What if dating feels too exhausting?**
Adjust your approach. Date less frequently, choose less draining activities, and give yourself more recovery time. You don't have to match anyone else's pace.

**Can I find connection without forcing myself into uncomfortable situations?**
Yes. Find dating approaches that work with your nature rather than against it. The right connections don't require becoming someone else.
