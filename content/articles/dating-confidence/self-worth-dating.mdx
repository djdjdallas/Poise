- Needing to prove worth
- Superiority

### Internal vs. External

**Fragile self-worth:**

## Practical Self-Worth Building

### Challenge Negative Self-Talk

**Notice when you think:**
- "I'm not good enough"
- "They're out of my league"
- "Who would want me?"

**Then challenge:**
- Is this objectively true?
- Would I say this to a friend?
- What evidence contradicts this?
- Where did this belief come from?

### Acknowledge Your Qualities

**Actually list:**
- What you offer in relationships
- Things you're good at
- What others appreciate about you
- Your unique qualities

**Not to brag, but to see reality.**

### Set and Hold Standards

**Practice worth by:**
- Deciding what you want
- Not settling for less
- Walking away from poor treatment
- Choosing people who value you

### Take Care of Yourself

**Self-care signals worth:**
- Meet your own needs
- Invest in your wellbeing
- Don't neglect yourself for dating
- Treat yourself with respect

- Unconditional
- Not performance-based
- More stable

### Building Both

**For self-esteem:**

- Build skills
- Achieve goals
- Take pride in actions

- Unconditional self-acceptance
- Deserve respect simply by existing

## FAQ

**How long does it take to build self-worth?**
It's ongoing work, not a destination. You'll likely see progress within months, but deeper changes take years. Start now anyway.

**Can you date while building self-worth?**
Yes, but be mindful. Dating can actually help you practice new patterns. Just don't look to dating to fix your worth.

**What if I've always felt unworthy?**
Long-standing worth issues may need professional help. Therapy can address root causes in ways self-help can't always reach.

**Does self-worth make you less tolerant of imperfect partners?**
Healthy self-worth means accepting human imperfection while not accepting mistreatment. You don't need perfection, you need respect.
