    "raw": "\n\nOne of the most common questions couples have when they start using Feeld together is: what exactly can my partner see? It's a reasonable concern. Whether you're new to ethical non-monogamy or just new to dating apps as a couple, understanding privacy boundaries is essential for building trust.\n\nThe short answer is: it depends on how you've set up your profiles. Feeld offers different levels of visibility depending on whether you're linked, unlinked, or somewhere in between. This guide breaks down exactly what your partner can and can't see in each scenario.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding Feeld's Profile Types\n\nBefore we dive into visibility, let's clarify the different ways couples can exist on Feeld.\n\n### Individual Profiles (Unlinked)\n\nEach person creates their own profile independently. You might mention in your bio that you're in a relationship, but technically your profiles aren't connected on the platform.\n\n**In this setup:**\n- You each have completely separate accounts\n- Neither person can see the other's activity\n- Your matches, likes, and conversations are entirely private\n- You're essentially two single users who happen to be in a relationship\n\n### Linked Profiles\n\nFeeld allows two profiles to \"link,\" creating a visible connection between them. When someone views either profile, they can see both partners and understand you're together.\n\n**In this setup:**\n- Both profiles display a link to the partner\n- Viewers can easily navigate between your profiles\n- You can match with people individually or as a couple\n- Certain activity may become visible to your partner (more on this below)\n\n### Shared/Couple Profiles\n\nSome couples create a single profile that represents both of them. This is different from linked profiles—it's one account operated by two people.\n\n**In this setup:**\n- One login, one profile, one inbox\n- Everything is shared by default\n- Both partners typically have access to the account\n\n---\n\n## What Your Partner CAN See (When Linked)\n\nLet's get specific. If you've linked your Feeld profiles, here's what becomes visible to your partner.\n\n### Your Profile Content\n\nThis one's obvious, but worth stating: your partner can see your profile the same way anyone else can. This includes:\n\n- Your photos\n- Your bio and \"about me\" section\n- Your listed desires and interests\n- Your relationship status and what you're looking for\n\nIf you've written something in your profile, assume your partner has read it. This is a feature, not a bug—it encourages honesty and alignment between partners about how you're presenting yourselves.\n\n### That You're Active on the App\n\nYour partner can generally tell when you've been active on Feeld. They won't get detailed timestamps or notification alerts, but:\n\n- If you're showing up in other people's feeds, you're clearly using the app\n- Linked profiles often show \"last active\" indicators\n- If you match with someone your partner knows or has seen, it creates visibility\n\n### Matches You Make Together\n\nWhen you match with someone as a linked couple—meaning the other person is interested in both of you—that match appears in both inboxes. Both partners can see:\n\n- The match itself\n- Any messages exchanged in that conversation\n- When the other person was last active\n\nThis shared visibility is intentional. It's designed for couples who want to explore together and communicate openly about their connections.\n\n---\n\n## What Your Partner CANNOT See (Even When Linked)\n\nHere's where it gets interesting. Linking profiles doesn't mean total transparency. Feeld maintains certain privacy boundaries even between linked partners.\n\n### Your Individual Swipe Activity\n\nYour partner cannot see:\n\n- Who you've swiped right on\n- Who you've swiped left on\n- How often you're swiping\n- Your \"behind the scenes\" browsing behavior\n\nYour partner might know you're using the app, but they don't have a log of every profile you've viewed or every decision you've made.\n\n### Likes You've Sent That Haven't Been Reciprocated\n\nIf you like someone and they don't like you back, that information stays private. Your partner won't know about unrequited interests unless you choose to share.\n\n### Individual Conversations\n\nThis is important: if you match with someone individually (not as a couple), those conversations are private to you. Your partner cannot:\n\n- Read your DMs with individual matches\n- See who you're actively messaging\n- Access conversation history\n\nThe exception is matches made \"as a couple\" where both partners have access to the shared conversation.\n\n### Your Search and Filter Settings\n\nYour preferences for what you're looking for—age ranges, distances, specific interests—remain private. Your partner can't see or modify your discovery settings.\n\n---\n\n## The Gray Areas: What Might Become Visible\n\nSome information exists in a middle ground—not automatically visible, but potentially discoverable.\n\n### Mutual Connections\n\nIf you and your partner both match with the same person, that becomes apparent. The other person might mention it, or you might see them in each other's match lists during a conversation.\n\n### Profile Views (Sometimes)\n\nDepending on membership tier and settings, some users can see who's viewed their profile. If your partner is Majestic (premium) and someone you've viewed mentions being viewed, dots could connect.\n\n### Real-World Conversations\n\nThe biggest \"leak\" in privacy isn't technical—it's social. If you match with someone in your local ENM community, word travels. Your partner might hear about your activity through mutual friends before they hear it from you.\n\n---\n\n## How to Set Privacy Boundaries as a Couple\n\nFeeld's technical privacy settings are only part of the equation. The more important work is establishing clear agreements with your partner about visibility and transparency.\n\n### Have the Conversation Before You Link\n\nBefore linking profiles, discuss:\n\n- **What level of transparency do you each want?** Some couples share everything; others prefer more independence.\n- **How will you handle individual matches?** Are you both open to dating separately, or only together?\n- **What counts as \"need to know\"?** Is there information you'd want your partner to share even if Feeld doesn't require it?\n\n### Decide on Disclosure Norms\n\nMany couples establish their own rules that go beyond what the app requires:\n\n- \"I'll tell you if I match with someone, even if you can't see it\"\n- \"I'll share when I'm actively chatting with someone new\"\n- \"I'll give you a heads up before meeting someone in person\"\n\nThese agreements should work for both of you. If one partner wants total transparency and the other wants more privacy, that's a conversation worth having before it becomes a conflict.\n\n### Check In Regularly\n\nPrivacy preferences can change. What felt comfortable when you first joined Feeld might feel different after a few months of use. Build in regular check-ins:\n\n- \"How are you feeling about our Feeld setup?\"\n- \"Is there anything you'd like more or less visibility on?\"\n- \"Are our current agreements still working?\"\n\n---\n\n## Common Questions About Partner Visibility\n\n### \"Can my partner see if I'm online right now?\"\n\nNot in real-time. They won't get a notification or see a green \"active now\" dot. However, if you're actively matching or messaging, your general activity level becomes apparent over time.\n\n### \"What if I want to browse without my partner knowing?\"\n\nYou can use Feeld independently, but if your profiles are linked, your partner knows you have the app. For true privacy, you'd need unlinked individual profiles—but that requires a conversation about why you want that separation.\n\n### \"Can we have different 'looking for' settings?\"\n\nYes. Even with linked profiles, you each maintain your own preferences for who you want to see and match with. Your discovery settings are independent.\n\n### \"What happens to our match history if we unlink?\"\n\nIf you unlink your profiles, you lose access to shared matches and conversations. Individual matches (where only one of you matched) remain with that person's profile.\n\n---\n\n## When Privacy Concerns Signal Bigger Issues\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: if you're very worried about what your partner can see on Feeld, that might be worth examining.\n\nFeeld is designed for people practicing ethical non-monogamy. The \"ethical\" part matters. If you're:\n\n- Hiding activity because you're doing something your partner wouldn't approve of\n- Worried about being \"caught\" doing something\n- Keeping secrets that would upset your partner if discovered\n\n...those aren't privacy concerns. Those are relationship concerns. No amount of app settings can fix misaligned values or broken agreements.\n\nThe healthiest couples on Feeld tend to have so much transparency that privacy settings barely matter. They talk about who they're interested in, share exciting matches, and treat the app as a joint adventure—even when they're using it independently.\n\n---\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nFeeld gives couples flexible privacy options. Linked profiles share some visibility—especially for shared matches and conversations—while maintaining privacy for individual browsing, unrequited likes, and personal conversations.\n\nBut the technology is just scaffolding. The real foundation is communication. Be clear with your partner about what level of visibility feels right, create agreements that honor both of your needs, and remember that transparency usually feels better than secrecy.\n\nIf you're just getting started on Feeld as a couple, take time to explore these settings together. Understanding what you each can and can't see makes the whole experience more comfortable—and more fun.\n\n---\n\n## Need Help Navigating Conversations on Feeld?\n\nOnce you match with someone, the real work begins.
