The app's focus on ENM, kink, and alternative relationships introduces unique considerations that go beyond standard dating app safety advice.\n\nThis guide covers everything you need to know to stay safe on Feeld: protecting your privacy, identifying fakes and scams, messaging safely, meeting in person, and navigating consent and boundaries in the ENM world.\n\n---\n\n## Is Feeld Safe?\n\nLet's address the fundamental question first.\n\n**Feeld as a platform:** The app itself has standard security measures—encrypted data, privacy settings, and moderation. It's a legitimate, established dating app used by millions.\n\n**Feeld's user base:** Like any dating platform, the quality and intentions of users vary. Most users are genuine, but bad actors exist everywhere.\n\n**The nature of the content:** Feeld's open discussion of desires and kinks can attract people who take advantage of that openness. It's important to stay aware.\n\n**Bottom line:** Feeld is as safe as most dating apps, with some additional privacy features. Your safety ultimately depends on your own awareness and choices.\n\n---\n\n## Profile Privacy Settings\n\nFeeld offers several privacy features. Use them wisely.\n\n### Hide from Contacts\n\n**What it does:** Reduces the chance of matching with people in your phone contacts.\n\n**How to use it:** Enable in settings, and consider which contacts you've imported.\n\n**Limitations:** It's not perfect—it depends on both parties having each other's numbers. If someone isn't in your contacts, or you're not in theirs, you might still see each other.\n\n**Recommendation:** Enable this if there's anyone in your life you want to avoid (colleagues, family members, etc.).\n\n### Incognito Mode (Majestic)\n\n**What it does:** Makes your profile invisible to others unless you like them first.\n\n**Who it's for:** People who need maximum discretion—public figures, those in sensitive professions, anyone who wants to control exactly who sees them.\n\n**Trade-offs:** You'll likely get fewer matches because others can't discover you first.\n\n**Recommendation:** Worth the Majestic subscription if privacy is critical for you.\n\n### Photo Privacy\n\n**What to consider:**\n- Your photos may be the most identifying element of your profile\n- Consider what's visible in backgrounds (home, workplace, identifiable locations)\n- First photos especially should balance being attractive with being appropriate\n- Feeld allows some photo control over who sees what\n\n**Recommendation:** Audit your photos for unintentionally revealing information.\n\n### Profile Visibility\n\n**Settings to know:**\n- Who can see your profile (all genders, specific genders, etc.)\n- Whether you appear in browse or only to those you've liked\n- Location visibility settings\n\n**Recommendation:** Review all visibility settings when you first create your profile and periodically after.\n\n---\n\n## Identifying Fake Profiles and Scams\n\nFake profiles and scams exist on all dating apps, including Feeld. Here's how to spot them:\n\n### Red Flags for Fake Profiles\n\n**Too good to be true:**\n- Model-quality photos that look professional\n- Profiles that seem designed to appeal to everyone\n- Extremely sexual content from the start\n- Claims that seem exaggerated\n\n**Inconsistencies:**\n- Photos that don't look like the same person\n- Details that change or contradict\n- Very little information in the profile\n- Stock photo aesthetics\n\n**Behavior patterns:**\n- Immediate intense interest without knowing you\n- Pushing to move off-app quickly\n- Refusal to video chat\n- Generic responses that don't address what you wrote\n\n### Common Feeld-Specific Scams\n\n**The cryptocurrency/investment pitch:**\nMatches who seem interested romantically but eventually steer conversation toward investment opportunities or crypto. This is always a scam.\n\n**The seller:**\nProfiles primarily interested in selling content, services, or promoting OnlyFans. While not necessarily malicious, it's not why most people are on Feeld.\n\n**The catfish:**\nSomeone using photos of another person to create a fake identity. Often discovered when they refuse to video chat or can't verify their identity.\n\n**The blackmailer:**\nSomeone who builds a connection, encourages you to share explicit content, then threatens to expose you. This is rare but serious.\n\n**The \"premium\" upgrade:**\nMessages claiming you need to pay to continue the conversation or access their profile. Feeld doesn't work this way.\n\n### How to Verify Someone Is Real\n\n**Video chat before meeting:**\nRequest a brief video call before any in-person meeting. Real people will understand; scammers will make excuses.\n\n**Reverse image search:**\nUpload their photos to Google Images or TinEye to see if they appear elsewhere as someone else.\n\n**Social media verification:**\nIf comfortable, connect on other platforms to verify their identity exists beyond Feeld.\n\n**Consistency check:**\nAsk questions over time and see if answers remain consistent.\n\n**Trust your gut:**\nIf something feels off, it probably is.\n\n---\n\n## Safe Messaging Practices\n\nBefore you meet anyone in person, there's a messaging phase. Stay safe during it.\n\n### Don't Share Identifying Information Too Early\n\n**Hold back on:**\n- Last name\n- Exact workplace\n- Home address\n- Daily routine details\n- Financial information\n\n**When to share:**\nOnly after you've verified they're real and built some trust—typically after a video chat and ideally after meeting in public first.\n\n### Be Cautious About Moving Off-App\n\n**Why people move to other platforms:**\n- Better messaging features\n- Sharing photos\n- Voice/video chat\n- Continuing if someone gets deleted\n\n**Risks of moving off-app:**\n- Losing Feeld's moderation and reporting\n- Sharing phone number or social media before ready\n- Making yourself more findable\n\n**Safer approach:**\n- Use Feeld messaging as long as it works\n- If you move, consider a Google Voice number or alternative messenger that doesn't reveal your main number\n- Only share real contact info once you've met and verified\n\n### Explicit Photo Sharing\n\nFeeld's culture is more open about desires, which can lead to sharing explicit photos. If you choose to do this:\n\n**Before sharing:**\n- Make sure you trust the person\n- Consider their verification level\n- Understand that anything shared digitally can potentially be saved\n\n**Protect yourself:**\n- Don't include your face in explicit photos\n- Strip metadata from images before sending\n- Consider apps that notify if screenshots are taken\n\n**Recognize pressure:**\n- Anyone who pressures you for photos is a red flag\n- \"If you're serious about meeting, you'll send...\" is manipulation\n- Real connections don't require explicit photos to progress\n\n---\n\n## Meeting Safely in Person\n\nYou've messaged, maybe video chatted, and now you want to meet. Here's how to do it safely:\n\n### General Meeting Safety\n\n**First meeting in public:**\nAlways. No exceptions. Coffee shops, bars, restaurants—places with other people around.\n\n**Tell someone your plans:**\nShare where you're going, who you're meeting, and when you expect to be back. Set up a check-in time.\n\n**Have your own transportation:**\nDon't depend on them for a ride. Know how you're getting there and back.\n\n**Keep your phone charged:**\nAnd accessible. Not in a bag you hand them to hold.\n\n**Trust your instincts:**\nIf something feels wrong, leave. You don't need to explain or be polite about it.\n\n**Limit alcohol on first meetings:**\nStay clear-headed until you know the person better.\n\n### Special Considerations for Meeting Couples\n\nMeeting a couple introduces unique dynamics:\n\n**Meet both partners:**\nIf you're potentially connecting with a couple, make sure both partners are present at the first meeting. One person meeting first \"on behalf of\" both is a red flag.\n\n**Watch for imbalances:**\nDoes one partner seem less enthusiastic? Is one doing all the talking while the other is quiet or uncomfortable? These dynamics matter.\n\n**Clarify expectations:**\nBefore meeting, understand what kind of connection they're looking for. First meeting should be getting-to-know-you, not an assumed sexual encounter.\n\n**Don't go to their home first:**\nMeet in public, even if both partners are there. Going to someone's home as a first meeting puts you in their space.\n\n**Maintain communication with both:**\nIdeally, be in contact with both partners, not just one as a gatekeeper.\n\n### Special Considerations for Kink Meetups\n\nIf your Feeld connection involves kink elements:\n\n**Negotiate extensively first:**\nBefore any scene or kink activity, have thorough conversations about:\n- Hard limits (things you won't do)\n- Soft limits (things you're uncertain about)\n- Safe words\n- Experience levels\n- Aftercare needs\n\n**Start slow:**\nNew kink partners should start with lighter activities before progressing.\n\n**Verify experience:**\nIf someone claims expertise, ask questions. Real experience comes with knowledge.\n\n**Have an exit plan:**\nKnow how you'd leave if needed. Tell someone where you are.\n\n**Community vetting:**\nIn the kink community, people often know each other's reputations. Ask around if possible.\n\n---\n\n## Consent and Boundaries in the ENM World\n\nFeeld's community takes consent seriously. Understanding how it works is essential.\n\n### What Consent Looks Like\n\n**Explicit:**\nConsent should be clearly communicated, not assumed from silence or vague signals.\n\n**Ongoing:**\nConsent at one moment doesn't mean consent forever. Check in regularly.\n\n**Specific:**\nConsent to one activity doesn't mean consent to all activities.\n\n**Revocable:**\nAnyone can change their mind at any time, without justification.\n\n**Enthusiastic:**\nLook for active participation and enthusiasm, not reluctant acceptance.\n\n### Communicating Your Boundaries\n\n**Before meeting:**\nBe clear about:\n- What you're open to\n- What you're not open to\n- Any hard limits\n- How fast you want to move\n\n**During connection:**\n- Check in about comfort levels\n- Ask before escalating\n- Read and respect body language\n- Stop if there's any uncertainty\n\n**After:**\n- Discuss how things felt\n- Address anything that felt uncomfortable\n- Be open to feedback\n\n### Red Flags for Consent Issues\n\n**Watch for people who:**\n- Push back against stated boundaries\n- Try to negotiate limits you've set\n- Say things like \"you'll like it once we try\"\n- Get upset when you decline activities\n- Pressure you with timelines or ultimatums\n- Don't discuss consent beforehand\n\n**These are warning signs.** People who respect boundaries don't push against them.\n\n### Couple-Specific Consent Issues\n\n**One partner consenting for both:**\nEach person must consent individually. \"My partner is okay with it\" isn't the partner's consent.\n\n**Veto dynamics:**\nUnderstand how their couple operates. Can one partner end the connection at any time? How is your consent protected in that dynamic?\n\n**Different desires within the couple:**\nWhat happens if you want to do something with one partner that the other isn't comfortable with? Discuss these scenarios before they happen.\n\n---\n\n## If Something Goes Wrong\n\nDespite precautions, things can go wrong. Know what to do.\n\n### On the App\n\n**Block and report:**\nIf someone is making you uncomfortable, violating app rules, or behaving inappropriately, block them and report to Feeld.\n\n**Document concerning behavior:**\nScreenshot relevant messages in case you need them later.\n\n**Trust moderation:**\nFeeld does remove bad actors when reported. Your report helps protect others too.\n\n### During a Date\n\n**Exit strategies:**\nHave planned excuses to leave early if needed. \"I have an early morning\" works.\n\n**Emergency contacts:**\nHave a friend who can call you with an \"emergency\" if you text a code word.\n\n**Location sharing:**\nConsider sharing your live location with a trusted friend during dates.\n\n**Public intervention:**\nIf you feel unsafe in a public place, ask bar staff or others for help. \"This person is making me uncomfortable\" is enough.\n\n### After an Incident\n\n**If boundaries were violated:**\n- You're not at fault\n- Consider seeking support (friends, therapy, hotlines)\n- You can report to law enforcement for serious violations\n- Document what happened while memory is fresh\n\n**If you were scammed:**\n- Report to Feeld\n- Report to relevant financial institutions if money was involved\n- File a report with local authorities if significant\n\n**If threatened (blackmail):**\n- Don't pay—it rarely ends the threats\n- Document everything\n- Consider reporting to law enforcement\n- Seek legal advice if needed\n\n---\n\n## Building a Safety Mindset\n\nSafety on Feeld isn't about paranoia—it's about awareness. The vast majority of your experiences will be positive. But having a safety mindset protects you when things go wrong.\n\n**Be aware, not afraid:**\nMost people on Feeld are exactly who they say they are, looking for genuine connections.\n\n**Verify before trusting:**\nTrust is built over time and evidence, not assumed from profiles or messages.\n\n**Communicate clearly:**\nClear communication about boundaries prevents most problems.\n\n**Trust your gut:**\nYour instincts evolved to protect you. If something feels off, respect that feeling.\n\n**Protect your fundamentals:**\nIdentity, location, financial information—protect these until trust is established.\n\n**Know when to exit:**\nHaving exit plans doesn't mean you'll need them. It just means you're prepared.\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n**National Domestic Violence Hotline:** 1-800-799-7233\n\n**RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network):** 1-800-656-4673\n\n**Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741\n\n**Local law enforcement:** For emergencies and reporting crimes\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nFeeld can be an incredible platform for genuine connection, exploration, and community. The openness of the community is one of its greatest strengths—and staying safe within that openness is about smart practices, not fear.\n\nBe clear about your boundaries. Verify people are who they claim. Meet in public first. Communicate openly. Trust your gut.\n\nWith these practices in place, you can explore with confidence, knowing you've taken steps to protect yourself.\n\n---\n\n## Looking for More Feeld Guidance?\n\nSafety is just one part of the equation.
