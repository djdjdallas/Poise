    "raw": "\n\nCouples dating together have a reputation problem—and often, it's earned. But it doesn't have to be that way.\n\nHere's how to date as a couple while treating everyone as a complete human being.\n\n---\n\n## The Problem Couples Create\n\n### Why Couples Get a Bad Reputation\n\nCommon complaints from people dating couples:\n- Treated as a fantasy, not a person\n- Expected to like both equally\n- Dropped as soon as complications arise\n- Given no voice in the relationship\n- Subject to rules they didn't create\n\n### The \"Unicorn Hunter\" Label\n\nThis label sticks because the pattern is so common:\n- Couple seeks attractive bi woman\n- She must date both equally\n- She can't date anyone else\n- She has less power than either partner\n- She's disposable when inconvenient\n\nEven well-meaning couples can fall into these patterns unconsciously.\n\n---\n\n## The Foundation: Couple Privilege Awareness\n\n### What Is Couple Privilege?\n\nThe built-in advantages an existing couple has:\n- Established relationship and trust\n- Shared history and resources\n- Unified position in conflicts\n- Ability to make decisions together (sometimes against the new person)\n- Social and legal recognition\n\n### Why It Matters\n\nCouple privilege isn't evil—but it's powerful. Unchecked, it leads to:\n- New partners feeling less-than\n- Decisions made without their input\n- Their needs consistently deprioritized\n- Power imbalances that breed resentment\n\n### What to Do About It\n\nAwareness is the first step:\n- Acknowledge your privilege\n- Actively work against imbalances\n- Give the new person voice and agency\n- Don't use \"we\" against them\n\n---\n\n## Ethical Couple Dating Principles\n\n### Principle 1: See People as People\n\n**Not:**\n- An addition to your relationship\n- A sexual fantasy come to life\n- Someone to \"enhance\" your bond\n- Interchangeable with other potential thirds\n\n**But:**\n- A complete person with their own needs\n- Someone with a full life outside you\n- A potential partner, not a plaything\n- Unique and irreplaceable\n\n### Principle 2: Equal Value (If Not Identical Structure)\n\nThe new person may have different relationships with each of you. That's okay.\n\nWhat they deserve:\n- Voice in decisions that affect them\n- Consideration of their needs\n- Respect equal to what you give each other\n- Genuine care for their wellbeing\n\n### Principle 3: Flexible Expectations\n\n**Don't require:**\n- Equal attraction to both partners\n- Identical relationship with each\n- Exclusive commitment to your couple\n- Adherence to your existing rules\n\n**Do allow:**\n- Organic connection development\n- Different dynamics with each partner\n- Their own outside relationships\n- Renegotiation of agreements\n\n### Principle 4: No Couple Veto\n\nIf either of you can \"veto\" the relationship:\n- The new person has no security\n- Their investment can be erased unilaterally\n- They're fundamentally less powerful\n\nBetter approach:\n- Each relationship stands on its own\n- Either individual can end their relationship\n- Neither can force the other to end theirs\n\n---\n\n## Practical Application\n\n### How to Write Your Profile\n\n**Instead of:**\n> \"Couple looking for our unicorn 🦄 Someone to join our relationship and have fun with us both!\"\n\n**Try:**\n> \"We're [names], partnered and dating together. We're looking to connect with someone who we could each build genuine relationships with. Open to what that looks like developing organically.\"\n\n### How to Message\n\n**Instead of:**\n> \"We think you're hot and would love to meet you!\"\n\n**Try:**\n> \"Hi! We both found your profile interesting. [Reference something specific]. Would you be open to chatting and seeing if we connect?\"\n\n### How to Handle Early Conversations\n\n**Ask about them:**\n- What are they looking for?\n- What's their experience with couples?\n- What concerns do they have?\n- What would they need to feel comfortable?\n\n**Share honestly:**\n- Your relationship structure\n- How you date together\n- What you're seeking\n- Your awareness of couple dynamics\n\n### How to Date\n\n**Both present:**\n- Be individuals, not a unit\n- Let them connect with each of you separately\n- Don't speak for each other\n- Make space for different relationships\n\n**Individual connection:**\n- Allow time one-on-one with each of you\n- Nurture separate bonds\n- Don't require both present always\n- Let natural dynamics emerge\n\n---\n\n## Handling the Complexities\n\n### When They Click More With One of You\n\n**This happens often.** Don't panic.\n\n**Options:**\n- Let that relationship develop while maintaining friendship with the other\n- Transition from triad to V structure\n- Accept that equal connection isn't required\n- Be flexible about what the relationship becomes\n\n**What not to do:**\n- Force equal time/connection\n- Punish them for natural chemistry\n- End everything because it's not the triad you imagined\n- Make them feel guilty\n\n### When Issues Arise\n\n**Conflict resolution should include them:**\n- Not: \"We talked and decided...\"\n- But: \"Can we all discuss this together?\"\n\n**Their voice matters:**\n- In decisions that affect them\n- In setting rules and boundaries\n- In how the relationship develops\n- In conflict resolution\n\n### When Things Don't Work\n\n**Ending ethically:**\n- Don't just ghost or drop them\n- Have an honest conversation\n- Each person ends their own relationship\n- Don't \"fire\" them together as a couple\n\n---\n\n## The Questions They Might Ask\n\n### \"What happens if you two fight?\"\n\n> \"We work to handle our conflicts between us without letting them affect you. If something does impact you, we'd want to talk about it rather than putting you in the middle.\"\n\n### \"Do I have to like you both equally?\"\n\n> \"No. We understand connections develop differently. We're open to what this looks like organically.\"\n\n### \"What if I develop stronger feelings for one of you?\"\n\n> \"That's something we can navigate. We're not requiring a perfectly balanced triad—we're open to what works for everyone.\"\n\n### \"Can I date other people?\"\n\n> \"Yes. We have each other; it wouldn't be fair to expect exclusivity from you when we can't offer it.\"\n\n### \"What are your rules?\"\n\n> \"We have some agreements, and we'd want your input on anything that affects you. Rules that involve you should include your voice.\"\n\n---\n\n## Red Flags in Your Own Behavior\n\n### Watch for These Signs\n\n**You might be problematic if:**\n- You talk about \"our third\" before meeting anyone\n- You expect instant chemistry with both of you\n- Your partner's approval is required for everything\n- The new person has no input on \"the rules\"\n- You see them primarily as enhancing your couple relationship\n- They can't have other partners but you have each other\n\n### Check In With Yourself\n\n**Ask:**\n- Am I treating them the way I'd want to be treated?\n- Do they have real voice and agency?\n- Would an outside observer see imbalance?\n- Am I seeing them as a full person or a role to fill?\n\n---\n\n## When Couples Do It Right\n\n### What Ethical Couple Dating Looks Like\n\n- New person feels valued and respected\n- Their needs are genuinely considered\n- Power is reasonably balanced\n- Relationships develop organically\n- Everyone has voice in decisions\n- It feels like partnership, not addition\n\n### The Rewards\n\nCouples who date ethically often find:\n- Deeper connections\n- More sustainable relationships\n- Richer dynamics\n- Personal growth for everyone\n- Expanded capacity for love\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [Avoiding Unicorn Hunting](/enm-communication/avoid-unicorn-hunting)\n- [Opening Up Without Blowing Up](/enm-communication/opening-up-guide)\n- [Feeld for Couples](/feeld-guide/feeld-for-couples)\n- [The Couple's Pre-Date Checklist](/feeld-guide/couple-predate-checklist)\n\n---\n\n## Connect with Integrity\n\nEthical couple dating requires intentional communication.
