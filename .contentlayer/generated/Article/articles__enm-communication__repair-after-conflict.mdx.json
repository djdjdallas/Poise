    "raw": "\nYou had the fight. Maybe it was a big blow-up, maybe a cold withdrawal, maybe a painful conversation that went wrong. Now what?\n\nIn ethical non-monogamy, conflict can feel especially loaded—there are more dynamics, more potential injuries, more complexity. But repair is just as possible, and just as important. Here's how to do it well.\n\n---\n\n## Why Repair Matters\n\n### Conflict Is Normal\n\nAll relationships have conflict. It doesn't mean:\n- You're incompatible\n- The relationship is failing\n- You're bad at ENM\n- Something is fundamentally broken\n\nConflict is information and opportunity. What you do with it determines the relationship's health.\n\n### Unrepaired Conflict Compounds\n\nLeft unaddressed, conflict:\n- Creates resentment\n- Erodes trust\n- Builds walls\n- Becomes patterns\n- Eventually destroys relationships\n\nRepair prevents accumulation.\n\n### Repair Builds Intimacy\n\nSuccessfully navigating conflict together can actually strengthen relationships:\n- You learn you can survive difficulty\n- You understand each other better\n- Trust deepens through resolution\n- You develop shared repair practices\n\n---\n\n## When to Start Repair\n\n### Not Immediately (Usually)\n\nRight after conflict, emotions are still activated:\n- You may not be thinking clearly\n- Things could escalate again\n- Processing hasn't happened yet\n- The nervous system needs to settle\n\n### How to Create Space\n\n> \"I need some time before we try to talk about this again. Can we take a few hours/until tomorrow?\"\n\n> \"I'm not ready to discuss this yet. I want to repair, and I want to do it when I can be thoughtful about it.\"\n\n### Signs You're Ready\n\n- Your body has calmed (not racing heart, tense muscles)\n- You can think about the conflict without flooding\n- You're interested in resolution, not winning\n- You can consider their perspective\n- You want connection more than you want to be right\n\n---\n\n## The Repair Process\n\n### Step 1: Reconnect Before Discussing\n\nBefore diving into content, reconnect:\n\n**Physical reconnection (if welcome):**\n- Sitting together\n- Gentle touch\n- Eye contact\n- Proximity\n\n**Emotional reconnection:**\n> \"I don't like when things are hard between us. I want to work through this together.\"\n\n> \"I love you and I want to get back to feeling connected. Can we try?\"\n\nThis establishes that you're approaching repair as partners, not adversaries.\n\n### Step 2: Acknowledge What Happened\n\nState what occurred without relitigating:\n\n> \"We had a fight about [topic]. Things got heated. I said some things I regret.\"\n\n> \"The conversation about [subject] didn't go well. I want to address the damage.\"\n\nAcknowledgment shows you're both aware of what needs repair.\n\n### Step 3: Take Responsibility (Your Part)\n\n**Own what you did:**\n- What you said that wasn't okay\n- How your behavior contributed\n- The impact you had\n\n**Not:**\n- \"I'm sorry you felt...\"\n- \"I wouldn't have done that if you hadn't...\"\n- \"Sorry, but you were also wrong\"\n\n**Yes:**\n> \"I raised my voice and said things that were hurtful. That wasn't okay regardless of how I was feeling. I'm sorry for that.\"\n\n> \"I shut down and withdrew, which left you hanging. I know that's hard for you and I regret responding that way.\"\n\n### Step 4: Validate Their Experience\n\nAcknowledge how they felt without defending yourself:\n\n> \"I can see that what I said really hurt you. That makes sense—those were harsh words.\"\n\n> \"You felt dismissed and unheard. I understand why, given how I responded.\"\n\nValidation doesn't mean agreeing you were entirely wrong. It means acknowledging their emotional reality.\n\n### Step 5: Listen to Their Side\n\nGive them space to share:\n- Without interrupting\n- Without getting defensive\n- Without planning your rebuttal\n- With genuine curiosity\n\n**Prompts:**\n> \"How are you feeling about what happened?\"\n> \"What did you need from me that you didn't get?\"\n> \"Is there more you need me to understand?\"\n\n### Step 6: Discuss What Happened (If Needed)\n\nSometimes understanding the content helps prevent recurrence:\n\n> \"I want to understand where we got off track. Can we talk about what happened without getting back into the conflict?\"\n\n**Focus on:**\n- What triggered the escalation\n- Where communication broke down\n- What you each were trying to say\n- What needs weren't getting met\n\n**Avoid:**\n- Determining who was \"right\"\n- Proving your point\n- Winning the original argument\n\n### Step 7: Identify What Would Help Going Forward\n\n**Discuss:**\n- What could have gone differently?\n- What do you each need in future conflicts?\n- Are there agreements to revisit?\n- What will you try next time?\n\n**Example:**\n> \"I realize I need to take a break before I get to the point of yelling. Can we agree that either of us can call a pause when things are escalating?\"\n\n### Step 8: Reconnect and Close\n\nEnd the repair intentionally:\n\n> \"I'm glad we talked about this. I feel closer to you now.\"\n\n> \"Thank you for being willing to work through this with me. I love you.\"\n\nSome couples have rituals: a hug, a shared activity, a physical reconnection.\n\n---\n\n## Types of Repair Conversations\n\n### After a Heated Fight\n\nWhen things got loud, angry, or hurtful:\n- Focus on the damage done\n- Acknowledge specific harmful words/actions\n- Work on de-escalation agreements for future\n\n### After a Cold Conflict\n\nWhen one or both withdrew, shut down, or went silent:\n- Acknowledge the disconnection\n- Explore what drove the withdrawal\n- Discuss how to stay present in conflict\n\n### After a Boundary Violation\n\nWhen something was crossed:\n- Take clear responsibility\n- Understand the impact\n- Recommit to the boundary\n- Discuss prevention\n\n### After a Values Clash\n\nWhen you disagreed on something fundamental:\n- Acknowledge the disagreement\n- Find where you do align\n- Determine if this is a dealbreaker or difference to navigate\n- Agree on how to handle the ongoing difference\n\n---\n\n## ENM-Specific Repair\n\n### When the Conflict Involves a Metamour\n\nIf your fight was about your partner's other relationship:\n\n**Don't:**\n- Make demands about that relationship as \"repair\"\n- Use the repair to relitigate the original issue\n- Require changes to their other relationship\n\n**Do:**\n- Focus on what you need from your partner\n- Acknowledge your feelings without blaming the metamour\n- Repair your relationship separately from their other one\n\n### When the Conflict Affects Multiple Relationships\n\nIf what happened touched multiple partners:\n\n**Consider:**\n- Who needs direct repair from you?\n- What's yours to repair vs. your partner's?\n- Should repairs happen separately or together?\n\n### When It's About ENM Itself\n\nIf you're fighting about polyamory, boundaries, or structure:\n\n**The repair:**\n- Acknowledge where you each stand\n- Determine if there's genuine incompatibility\n- Find what you can agree on\n- Accept that some differences may persist\n\n---\n\n## When Repair Is Hard\n\n### If They Won't Engage\n\nIf your partner isn't ready or willing:\n- Give them time (but set reasonable limits)\n- Express your desire for repair clearly\n- Ask what they need to be ready\n- Recognize you can't force it\n\n### If It Keeps Happening\n\nIf you're repairing the same conflict repeatedly:\n- The underlying issue isn't being addressed\n- You may need outside help (therapist, mediator)\n- Consider if this is a compatibility issue\n- Look at patterns, not just incidents\n\n### If Trust Is Damaged\n\nFor serious breaches:\n- Repair takes longer\n- Actions matter more than words\n- Trust rebuilds through consistent behavior\n- Some damage requires professional help\n\n### If You Can't Forgive\n\nIf you're stuck in resentment:\n- Consider what you need to let go\n- Therapy can help process\n- Recognize that unforgiveness hurts you too\n- Some things may be unforgivable—that's information\n\n---\n\n## Repair Scripts\n\n### Taking Responsibility\n\n> \"I want to own my part in what happened. I [specific behavior] and I can see how that [impact]. I'm sorry, and I'm committed to doing better.\"\n\n### Asking for Repair\n\n> \"I don't want this distance between us. I know we need to work through what happened. Can we find a time to talk and try to repair?\"\n\n### Checking In\n\n> \"How are you feeling about us after our fight? I want to make sure we've actually worked through it, not just moved past it.\"\n\n### Closing Repair\n\n> \"I appreciate you being willing to have this conversation. I feel like we understand each other better now. I love you.\"\n\n---\n\n## Building a Repair Culture\n\n### Regular Check-Ins\n\nDon't wait for conflict to communicate:\n- Weekly or bi-weekly relationship check-ins\n- Addressing small issues before they grow\n- Normalizing feedback and discussion\n\n### Repair Agreements\n\nEstablish how you'll handle repair:\n- Time limits on silence after conflict\n- Agreements about who initiates\n- Safe words for de-escalation\n- Commitment to not going to bed angry (or modified version)\n\n### Celebrate Repair\n\nWhen you successfully navigate conflict:\n- Acknowledge it\n- Note what worked\n- Feel the strengthened connection\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**How long should I wait before trying to repair?**\nLong enough to be calm, not so long that distance solidifies. Hours to a day is typical; longer gaps risk resentment.\n\n**What if they won't apologize?**\nYou can repair your part regardless of their apology. But ongoing refusal to take responsibility is concerning.\n\n**Can some conflicts not be repaired?**\nYes. Fundamental incompatibilities, repeated betrayals, or unwillingness to engage may make repair impossible.\n\n**Should we always process conflict together?**\nNot necessarily. Some individual processing helps. But relationship repair requires shared conversation.\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [How to Have Difficult Conversations in Polyamory](/enm-communication/difficult-conversations-poly)\n- [Processing Big Emotions in Polyamory](/enm-communication/processing-emotions-poly)\n- [Self-Soothing Skills for Polyamory](/enm-communication/self-soothing-poly)\n\n---\n\n## Repair Is a Skill\n\nThe ability to come back together after conflict defines relationship success.
