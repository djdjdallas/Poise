    "raw": "\n\nTinder is the dating app that everyone knows. Feeld is the one that everyone curious about alternatives discovers eventually. They're both swiping apps, they're both for finding connections—but they serve very different purposes and communities.\n\nThis comparison breaks down the real differences between Feeld and Tinder across every dimension that matters: who uses them, what features they offer, how they feel to use, and most importantly, which one is right for you.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Comparison Table\n\n| Aspect | Feeld | Tinder |\n|--------|-------|--------|\n| **Primary audience** | ENM, curious, kink-friendly | General dating market |\n| **Relationship focus** | Open, poly, casual, exploratory | Hookups to relationships |\n| **User base size** | Smaller, niche | Massive, mainstream |\n| **Gender/orientation options** | Very inclusive (20+) | More limited |\n| **Couple profiles** | Yes, built-in | No |\n| **Kink/desire features** | Yes, extensive | No |\n| **Typical age range** | 25-45 | 18-40 |\n| **Monthly cost (premium)** | $15-30 | $15-30 |\n| **Discretion features** | Strong | Limited |\n| **Matching algorithm** | Desire-based | Basic swipe |\n\n---\n\n## User Base and Demographics\n\n### Feeld Users\n\nFeeld attracts a specific type of person:\n\n**Relationship orientation:**\n- Ethically non-monogamous (ENM)\n- Polyamorous\n- Open relationships\n- Curious about alternatives to monogamy\n- Kink-friendly and kink-focused\n- LGBTQ+ and queer\n- Couples seeking thirds or other couples\n\n**Demographics:**\n- Tends to skew slightly older (late 20s to 40s)\n- Higher proportion of professionals\n- More urban/metropolitan\n- More likely to have thought intentionally about relationships\n- Higher education levels on average\n\n**Mindset:**\n- Generally more open to discussing desires explicitly\n- Comfortable with non-traditional relationship structures\n- Often part of broader ENM/kink communities\n- Looking for specific types of connections\n\n### Tinder Users\n\nTinder casts the widest net:\n\n**Relationship orientation:**\n- Primarily monogamy-seeking\n- Hookups to serious relationships\n- Casual dating\n- Looking for traditional dating experiences\n- Some ENM users, but not the primary market\n\n**Demographics:**\n- Broadest age range (heavily 18-35)\n- All socioeconomic backgrounds\n- Urban, suburban, and rural\n- Mainstream dating market\n- General population representation\n\n**Mindset:**\n- Fast-paced swiping\n- Volume-based approach\n- Less explicit about desires\n- Expecting mainstream dating dynamics\n\n### What This Means for You\n\n**Choose Feeld if:** You're looking for people who share non-mainstream relationship interests and are willing to discuss them openly.\n\n**Choose Tinder if:** You want the largest possible pool of potential matches without filtering by relationship philosophy.\n\n---\n\n## Features Comparison\n\n### Profile Creation\n\n**Feeld:**\n- Extensive gender options (20+)\n- Multiple orientation selections\n- Couple profile linking\n- Desire tags (intimate preferences)\n- Interest tags (hobbies/lifestyle)\n- Relationship status selection\n- Partner visibility preferences\n\n**Tinder:**\n- Basic gender options (expanded in recent years)\n- Standard orientation selections\n- Individual profiles only\n- Bio text only\n- Anthem (music) and other lifestyle add-ons\n- Job and education fields\n\n**Winner:** Feeld for customization and specificity; Tinder for simplicity.\n\n### Matching Mechanics\n\n**Feeld:**\n- Desire-based matching (aligned interests surface)\n- Ping feature (direct interest signal)\n- Hide from contacts feature\n- Less aggressive algorithm\n- Quality over quantity focus\n\n**Tinder:**\n- Swipe-based matching\n- Super Like feature\n- Boost and Super Boost for visibility\n- Algorithm optimized for engagement\n- Volume-based matching\n\n**Winner:** Depends on your goal. Feeld for intentional matching; Tinder for volume.\n\n### Privacy and Discretion\n\n**Feeld:**\n- Incognito mode (Majestic)\n- Hide from contacts\n- Hide from specific demographics\n- Photo blurring options\n- Designed for discretion\n\n**Tinder:**\n- Hide distance option\n- Block contacts (premium)\n- Less discretion-focused overall\n- More visible by design\n\n**Winner:** Feeld, significantly. Built for users who need privacy.\n\n### Premium Features\n\n**Feeld Majestic:**\n- See who liked you\n- Advanced filters\n- Incognito mode\n- Activity status\n- More pings\n- Unlimited rewinds\n\n**Tinder Gold/Platinum:**\n- See who liked you\n- Unlimited likes\n- Passport (location change)\n- Boost per month\n- Super Likes\n- Priority likes\n- Message before matching (Platinum)\n\n**Winner:** Comparable value; different features aligned with each app's focus.\n\n---\n\n## The Experience: How They Feel to Use\n\n### Using Feeld\n\nThe Feeld experience is:\n\n**More intentional:** You're not just swiping through endless faces. You're reading profiles, considering Desires, and making informed decisions.\n\n**More explicit:** People are direct about what they want. Bios mention relationship structures, desires, and specific interests openly.\n\n**More niche:** The pool is smaller, but more aligned. You see fewer profiles but higher compatibility.\n\n**More patient:** Conversations develop slower. People are thoughtful, not rushing.\n\n**More couples:** You will encounter couples. That's the reality of the user base.\n\n**More diverse desires:** The range of what people are looking for is much wider than mainstream apps.\n\n### Using Tinder\n\nThe Tinder experience is:\n\n**More casual:** Swipe, swipe, swipe. It's designed for volume and speed.\n\n**More mainstream:** Profiles look like what you'd expect. Standard bios, standard photos, standard approach.\n\n**More gamified:** The swipe mechanic, the boost features, the notifications—all designed for engagement.\n\n**More varied:** You'll match with people seeking everything from hookups to marriage, and you often don't know which until you talk.\n\n**More competitive:** Lots of users, but also lots of competition. Standing out is harder.\n\n**More transactional:** The fast-paced nature can feel impersonal.\n\n---\n\n## Cultural Differences\n\n### Feeld Culture\n\n**Normalizes non-monogamy:** ENM isn't alternative here—it's mainstream within the app.\n\n**Values communication:** The community places high importance on discussing boundaries, desires, and expectations.\n\n**Celebrates diversity:** Gender, orientation, and relationship structure diversity is embraced and built into the app.\n\n**Has community norms:** There are unwritten rules (how to treat thirds, how to communicate as couples, etc.) that experienced users know.\n\n**Can feel like a scene:** Regular users often overlap with real-world ENM and kink communities.\n\n### Tinder Culture\n\n**Assumes monogamy:** The default expectation is one-on-one, heading toward exclusivity.\n\n**More implicit communication:** Fewer explicit conversations about what people want.\n\n**Mainstream values:** Standard dating dynamics, standard expectations.\n\n**Competitive and image-focused:** Photos and first impressions dominate.\n\n**Anonymous:** Users often don't overlap in real-world communities.\n\n---\n\n## When to Choose Each App\n\n### Choose Feeld If:\n\n**You're non-monogamous**\nWhether ENM, poly, open, or just curious—Feeld's user base gets it.\n\n**You're part of a couple**\nFeeld is one of the few apps that actually supports couple dating.\n\n**You're kink-curious or kinky**\nThe Desires feature and community culture support open kink discussion.\n\n**You value quality over quantity**\nSmaller pool, but more aligned matches.\n\n**You need discretion**\nIncognito mode and privacy features are built in.\n\n**You're LGBTQ+ and want nuance**\nMore gender and orientation options than most apps.\n\n**You want intentional connections**\nThe culture supports thoughtful, communicative dating.\n\n### Choose Tinder If:\n\n**You want the largest possible pool**\nTinder has the most users, period.\n\n**You're looking for mainstream dating**\nStandard monogamous dating is Tinder's sweet spot.\n\n**You're in a smaller area**\nTinder's large user base means more matches in less populated areas.\n\n**You prefer fast-paced swiping**\nIf you like the gamified, high-volume approach.\n\n**You're young (18-25)**\nTinder's user base skews younger than Feeld's.\n\n**You want simplicity**\nLess to configure, more straightforward.\n\n**You're traveling**\nPassport feature lets you match in other locations.\n\n---\n\n## Can You Use Both?\n\nAbsolutely. Many people use Feeld and Tinder simultaneously:\n\n**Use Feeld for:** Specific connections, ENM dating, kink, couples, quality matches.\n\n**Use Tinder for:** Volume, casual connections, broader dating market, areas where Feeld has fewer users.\n\n### Tips for Using Both\n\n**Keep profiles consistent:** Your photos and general vibe should align across platforms.\n\n**Adjust bios for audience:** What works on Feeld might not work on Tinder and vice versa.\n\n**Manage expectations:** Different apps, different outcomes. Don't expect Feeld results from Tinder or vice versa.\n\n**Don't overwhelm yourself:** Active on two apps can be a lot. Consider focusing on one at a time.\n\n---\n\n## Specific Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: New to Non-Monogamy\n\n**Recommendation:** Start with Feeld.\n\nThe community is more understanding of newcomers exploring ENM. People expect questions and communication about boundaries. On Tinder, you'd need to explain ENM to people who might not understand.\n\n### Scenario 2: Looking for Casual Hookups\n\n**Recommendation:** Either could work, but Tinder offers more volume.\n\nFeeld has casual connections too, but if sheer numbers is your strategy, Tinder delivers more.\n\n### Scenario 3: Couple Looking to Date\n\n**Recommendation:** Feeld, definitely.\n\nTinder doesn't support couple profiles. You'd need separate individual accounts and a lot of awkward explaining.\n\n### Scenario 4: Single in a Small Town\n\n**Recommendation:** Tinder first, then add Feeld.\n\nFeeld's smaller user base means limited options in less populated areas. Tinder's reach is broader.\n\n### Scenario 5: Kink-Focused Dating\n\n**Recommendation:** Feeld.\n\nThe Desires feature and community culture support kink openly. Tinder doesn't have equivalent features.\n\n### Scenario 6: Just Want to Meet People\n\n**Recommendation:** Tinder for volume, Feeld for vibe.\n\nIt depends what kind of people you want to meet. Tinder gets you more; Feeld gets you more intentional.\n\n---\n\n## The Honest Truth\n\nNeither app is objectively better—they serve different needs.\n\n**Tinder** is a massive, mainstream, volume-focused app that works for traditional dating and casual connections. Its strength is reach.\n\n**Feeld** is a niche, community-focused app that works for ENM, kink, and curious daters who want intentional connections. Its strength is alignment.\n\nThe question isn't \"which is better?\" but \"which matches what I'm looking for?\"\n\nKnow what you want, pick the app that serves it, and approach it with appropriate expectations. Or use both, for different purposes.\n\n---\n\n## Whichever App You Choose, Your Profile Matters\n\nWhether you're on Feeld, Tinder, or both—your profile and messages determine your success.
