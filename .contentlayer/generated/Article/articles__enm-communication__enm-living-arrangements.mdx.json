How do you host other partners? What structures actually work?\n\nHere are the options and what to consider for each.\n\n---\n\n## Living Arrangement Options\n\n### Option 1: Living with One Nesting Partner\n\n**What it looks like:**\nYou live with one partner (your \"nesting partner\") and have other relationships that don't involve cohabitation.\n\n**How it works:**\n- Your home is shared with one person\n- Other partners visit or you visit them\n- The nesting partner often has more practical integration (shared finances, domestic duties)\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Clear home base and stability\n- Familiar domestic partnership model\n- Easier to explain to outside world\n- Financial benefits of shared housing\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Can create implicit hierarchy\n- Other partners may feel secondary\n- Hosting space for other relationships\n- Nesting partner's comfort with visitors\n\n### Option 2: Solo Living (Solo Poly)\n\n**What it looks like:**\nYou maintain your own living space, not cohabiting with any partner.\n\n**How it works:**\n- Your home is yours alone\n- Partners visit but don't live with you\n- Each relationship has similar access (none are co-housed)\n- You control your space and schedule\n\n**Advantages:**\n- No built-in hierarchy from living situation\n- Full autonomy over your space\n- Privacy and independence\n- Flexibility in how each relationship develops\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Financial cost of solo living\n- Lack of domestic partnership benefits\n- Can feel isolating\n- Logistical complexity for overnights\n\n### Option 3: Living with Multiple Partners\n\n**What it looks like:**\nYou share a home with more than one romantic partner.\n\n**Configurations:**\n- All partners live together (V, triad, quad, etc.)\n- Partners live in same building, different units\n- Intentional community with romantic and non-romantic members\n\n**How it works:**\n- Multiple people share domestic space\n- Requires agreements about shared spaces, privacy, visitors\n- Financial arrangements can be complex\n- Household management involves multiple adults\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Integration of multiple relationships\n- Shared resources and costs\n- Built-in community\n- Less time lost to travel between partners\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Complex group dynamics\n- Privacy concerns\n- Disagreements affect everyone\n- Finding suitable housing\n- If relationships change, housing is affected\n\n### Option 4: Neighboring\n\n**What it looks like:**\nPartners live separately but nearby—same building, same block, same neighborhood.\n\n**How it works:**\n- Each person/couple has their own space\n- Easy access to each other\n- Maintains autonomy while reducing distance\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Proximity without cohabitation\n- Each relationship has dedicated space\n- Flexibility and privacy\n- Can scale up or down easily\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Requires luck or resources to achieve\n- May feel like a compromise\n- Neighborhood dynamics if things change\n\n---\n\n## Considerations for Each Arrangement\n\n### Financial Considerations\n\n**Questions to address:**\n- Who pays for what?\n- How are shared expenses divided?\n- What about assets and equity?\n- How does income difference affect contributions?\n- What happens if someone moves out?\n\n**For solo living:**\n- Can you afford it?\n- Is it worth the cost for the autonomy?\n\n**For cohabitation:**\n- Fair division of costs\n- Legal protections (whose name is on the lease/deed?)\n- Financial impact of relationship changes\n\n### Space and Privacy\n\n**Questions to address:**\n- Where can partners spend time with you?\n- How do you handle visits from other partners?\n- What's off-limits in your space?\n- How much privacy does each person need?\n\n**Practical solutions:**\n- Guest bedrooms or spaces\n- Clear agreements about when space is available\n- Soundproofing or privacy considerations\n- Schedules that provide alone time\n\n### Hosting Other Partners\n\n**When living with a nesting partner:**\n- Is hosting allowed?\n- What spaces are available?\n- How much notice is needed?\n- What makes your nesting partner comfortable?\n\n**Sample agreement:**\n> \"Other partners can visit and stay overnight. Guest room is available. 24-hour notice preferred. No hosting when nesting partner is having a hard time without conversation first.\"\n\n### When Relationships Change\n\n**Consider in advance:**\n- What if a nesting relationship ends?\n- What if someone wants to move in?\n- What if someone wants to move out?\n- How do you handle transitions?\n\n**Protective measures:**\n- Lease agreements that allow for change\n- Financial plans for various scenarios\n- Communication agreements about big decisions\n\n---\n\n## Making Decisions About Living Arrangements\n\n### What to Consider\n\n**Your values:**\n- How important is autonomy vs. partnership?\n- Do you want domestic partnership or independence?\n- How do you want hierarchy to play out (if at all)?\n\n**Your resources:**\n- Can you afford to live alone?\n- Do you need a partner's income to afford housing?\n- What housing is available in your area?\n\n**Your relationships:**\n- What do your partners want?\n- What would changing arrangements mean for each relationship?\n- Is everyone aligned on living situation goals?\n\n### Conversations to Have\n\n**With yourself:**\n- What living situation would I thrive in?\n- What are my non-negotiables?\n- What am I willing to compromise on?\n\n**With partners:**\n- What are your hopes for living arrangements?\n- How would various configurations affect you?\n- What concerns do you have?\n\n### Taking It Step by Step\n\nYou don't have to figure it all out at once:\n- Start with what's currently working and not working\n- Identify what you'd ideally want\n- Explore what's possible given constraints\n- Make incremental changes as appropriate\n\n---\n\n## Common Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Adding a Partner When You Live Together\n\n**Situation:** You live with Partner A. Partner B is becoming more serious and wants more integration.\n\n**Questions:**\n- What does Partner B want? (More visits? Moving in? Living nearby?)\n- How does Partner A feel about changes?\n- What space constraints exist?\n- How would this affect the relationship balance?\n\n**Possible approaches:**\n- More overnight hosting\n- Partner B getting their own place nearby\n- Moving to a larger space with room for hosting\n- In some cases, communal living\n\n### Scenario 2: Transitioning to Solo Poly\n\n**Situation:** You live with a partner but want more autonomy. Considering solo living.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Why is solo living appealing?\n- What would it mean for your nesting partnership?\n- Can you afford it?\n- Is your partner open to this change?\n\n**Possible approaches:**\n- Discussing the desire and its origins\n- Exploring what specifically isn't working\n- Gradual transition (staying separately some nights)\n- Full transition to separate spaces\n\n### Scenario 3: Combining Households\n\n**Situation:** You want to live with multiple partners or have them live together.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Is everyone enthusiastically on board?\n- What are the household logistics?\n- How will finances work?\n- What happens if it doesn't work out?\n\n**Before proceeding:**\n- Extended time together first (vacations, long visits)\n- Clear agreements about household management\n- Financial and legal planning\n- Exit strategy conversations\n\n---\n\n## When Living Situations Create Hierarchy\n\n### The Unspoken Impact\n\nCohabitation creates practical hierarchy even if you don't intend it:\n- More time together\n- More domestic integration\n- More convenience for the relationship\n- Different visibility to the world\n\n### Addressing It\n\n**Acknowledge it:**\n> \"Living with Partner A means they get more of my daily life. I want to make sure you know that's about logistics, not importance.\"\n\n**Compensate where possible:**\n- Dedicated quality time with non-nesting partners\n- Integration in other ways (meeting friends, attending events)\n- Clear communication about what cohabitation does and doesn't mean\n\n**Consider alternatives:**\n- Could a different arrangement work better?\n- Is the current hierarchy acceptable to everyone?\n- What would a more equitable setup look like?\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Is solo poly more ethical than nesting?**\nNo. Both are valid choices with different tradeoffs. What matters is honest communication and everyone's needs being considered.\n\n**Can you have a nesting partner and practice non-hierarchical poly?**\nIt's complicated. Cohabitation creates practical hierarchy even without intentional hierarchy. Being honest about this is important.\n\n**What if my partners want different living arrangements?**\nNavigate it through communication. Sometimes compromises exist; sometimes there are genuine incompatibilities to work through.\n\n**How do I bring up wanting to change our living situation?**\nHonestly and kindly. Frame it around your needs and desires, not criticism of the current situation. Be open to dialogue.\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [Moving In Together in Polyamory](/enm-communication/nesting-transition)\n- [Poly Calendar Systems That Actually Work](/enm-communication/poly-calendar-systems)\n- [How to Divide Time Between Partners Fairly](/enm-communication/dividing-time-partners)\n\n---\n\n## Home Is Where the Heart(s) Are\n\nYour living arrangement shapes how you do polyamory.
