    "raw": "\nYou matched with a couple on Feeld. Now comes the tricky part: How do you message two people at once? How do you show interest in both without it feeling awkward? What do couples even want to hear?\n\nMessaging couples requires a slightly different approach than messaging individuals. Here's how to get it right.\n\n---\n\n## Why Messaging Couples Is Different\n\n### Two People, One Profile\n\nWhen you message a couple, you're essentially:\n- Introducing yourself to two separate people\n- Trying to create interest with both\n- Navigating their established dynamic\n- Entering an existing relationship\n\n### Common Concerns Couples Have\n\nCouples often worry about:\n- Being seen as objects (especially if seeking a \"third\")\n- People who are only interested in one of them\n- Flaky connections who disappear\n- Disrespectful approaches\n\nYour opening message can address these concerns.\n\n### The Extra Scrutiny\n\nCouples often have two people reviewing messages, which means:\n- Higher standards (both need to be interested)\n- More careful vetting\n- Longer decision-making process\n- Both need to feel seen\n\n---\n\n## Openers That Work\n\n### Acknowledge Both People\n\n**Don't just address one person:**\n\n❌ \"Hey, you're really hot\"\n✅ \"Hey! You both seem like interesting people. What caught my eye was [something from their profile].\"\n\n**Reference their dynamic:**\n\n> \"I love that you two share [interest from their profile]. That's something I appreciate in couples—genuine shared enthusiasm.\"\n\n> \"Your profile gives me the sense that you're both actually on the same page about this. That's refreshing.\"\n\n### Reference Something Specific\n\n**Show you read their profile:**\n\n> \"I noticed you mentioned you're both into hiking. Where's your favorite trail around here?\"\n\n> \"You said you're looking for genuine connection—what does that look like for you two?\"\n\n> \"Your photos from [location] looked amazing. Have you traveled anywhere else together recently?\"\n\n### Ask About Their Experience\n\n**Curious questions work well:**\n\n> \"How long have you been exploring this together? I'm curious what drew you to opening things up.\"\n\n> \"What's been your experience on Feeld so far? Meeting the right people?\"\n\n> \"What made you decide to try Feeld as a couple?\"\n\n### Show What Makes You Interesting\n\n**Brief self-introduction that creates intrigue:**\n\n> \"I'm [brief interesting detail about yourself]. Your profile caught my attention because [reason]. Hoping to hear back from you both!\"\n\n> \"I don't usually message couples, but something about your profile felt different. [What that was]. I'd love to learn more about what you're looking for.\"\n\n---\n\n## Templates By Situation\n\n### For Couples Seeking a Third\n\n**Respectful and curious:**\n\n> \"Hey! I saw you're looking for someone to connect with as a couple. I'm curious about how you envision that—everyone has different hopes for what these connections look like. What would make this feel successful for you both?\"\n\n**Showing genuine interest in both:**\n\n> \"What stood out to me was [specific thing about them]. I appreciate when couples are clear about what they want. I'm interested in connecting with both of you if there's chemistry—not just one of you.\"\n\n### For Couples Open to Various Connections\n\n**Keeping options open:**\n\n> \"I noticed your profile is pretty open about what you're looking for. I appreciate that. I'm curious what kinds of connections have worked well for you both before?\"\n\n> \"You two seem open-minded about connection types. What's worked best for you in the past—group situations, individual connections, something else?\"\n\n### For Couples Who Seem Like Friends\n\n**If their profile has warm, friendly energy:**\n\n> \"Your profile made me smile—you two seem like you'd be fun to hang out with whether things went anywhere physical or not. What are you actually hoping to find here?\"\n\n### For Couples Into Similar Things as You\n\n**Shared interests:**\n\n> \"We're apparently into the same things! [Shared interest]. How did you both get into that?\"\n\n> \"I saw [specific interest] in your profile. That's something I've been wanting to explore more. How has your experience been with it?\"\n\n---\n\n## What to Avoid\n\n### Objectifying Language\n\n❌ \"You're both so sexy, I'd love to be your unicorn\"\n❌ \"Hot couple! Let's have some fun\"\n❌ \"Looking for a third? I'm available\"\n\nThese reduce you to a fantasy object and reduce them to a sex opportunity. Even if everyone is looking for something casual, respect matters.\n\n### Focusing on Just One Person\n\n❌ \"Wow [one person's name], you're gorgeous\"\n❌ \"She's beautiful—you're a lucky guy\"\n\nThis creates awkwardness and makes the other person feel invisible.\n\n### Generic Openings\n\n❌ \"Hey\"\n❌ \"How's it going?\"\n❌ \"Nice profile\"\n\nThese are low-effort and get lost among other messages.\n\n### Immediate Sexual Propositions\n\n❌ \"Want to meet up tonight?\"\n❌ \"What are you into sexually?\"\n❌ \"I can show you a good time\"\n\nEven when the ultimate goal is sexual connection, jumping straight there is off-putting.\n\n---\n\n## Navigating the Conversation\n\n### Who's Actually Responding?\n\nOften one person manages the couple's account. You might be talking to:\n- One person speaking for both\n- Both people alternating\n- One person who checks with their partner\n\n**It's okay to ask:**\n> \"Just curious—am I chatting with both of you or one of you primarily?\"\n\n### Building Connection with Both\n\n**Even if one person is messaging:**\n- Ask about both of them\n- Reference both when relevant\n- Don't form too strong a bond with just the messenger\n\n**Phrases that include both:**\n> \"What do you both think about [topic]?\"\n> \"Is that something you're both interested in?\"\n> \"Tell me more about what you're both looking for\"\n\n### Moving to Meeting\n\n**When it feels right:**\n> \"I've really enjoyed chatting with you both. Would you be up for meeting in person? I'm thinking somewhere low-key where we can all talk—coffee, drinks?\"\n\n> \"I feel like we've got good chemistry via text. What would next steps look like for you two?\"\n\n---\n\n## Red Flags to Watch\n\n### From Couples\n\n**Be cautious if:**\n- Only one person seems interested\n- They pressure you before you're ready\n- They're vague about their dynamic or what they want\n- They treat you as interchangeable with any \"third\"\n- Their communication is disorganized or contradictory\n\n### Signs of Good Couples\n\n**Green flags:**\n- Both seem engaged (even if one is primarily messaging)\n- Clear about what they're looking for\n- Respectful of your boundaries and timeline\n- Genuine interest in you as a person\n- Consistent and reliable communication\n\n---\n\n## After the Opener\n\n### Keep Momentum\n\nOnce they respond:\n- Keep asking about both of them\n- Share about yourself proportionally\n- Move toward concrete plans within a reasonable timeframe\n- Don't let the conversation stall\n\n### Managing Three-Way Conversation\n\nIf you end up in a group chat or both are messaging:\n- Address both by name\n- Respond to both people's points\n- Don't play them against each other\n- Enjoy the unique dynamic\n\n### Meeting In Person\n\nFirst meetings with couples:\n- Public place, all three present\n- Be yourself—don't try to impress\n- Pay attention to dynamics between them\n- Check in with yourself about your comfort\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Should I message couples differently if I'm a single woman vs. man?**\nThe basic approach is the same, but couples do sometimes respond differently based on who's messaging. Focus on being respectful and genuine regardless.\n\n**What if I'm only attracted to one of them?**\nBe honest with yourself about whether this can work. If you're genuinely only interested in one person, it may not be the right match.\n\n**How do I know if they're really a couple or fake?**\nLinked profiles, recent photos together, consistent stories, video calls before meeting all help verify.\n\n**What if they want different things from me?**\nThis is common and something to discuss. Clear communication about each person's hopes helps navigate this.\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [30 Feeld Conversation Starters That Actually Work](/feeld-guide/feeld-conversation-starters)\n- [How to Keep a Feeld Conversation Going](/feeld-guide/feeld-keep-conversation-going)\n- [Feeld for Couples: Profile Tips](/feeld-guide/feeld-couple-profile-tips)\n\n---\n\n## Make Both People Feel Seen\n\nMessaging couples well means treating them as two individuals who happen to be together.
