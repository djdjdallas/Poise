    "raw": "\n\nNot everything labeled \"ethical non-monogamy\" is actually ethical. Some people use ENM as cover for cheating, manipulation, or one-sided arrangements that harm partners.\n\nHere's how to distinguish genuine ENM from the toxic alternatives.\n\n---\n\n## What Makes Non-Monogamy \"Ethical\"\n\n### The Core Requirements\n\nFor non-monogamy to be ethical, it needs:\n- **Full informed consent** from everyone affected\n- **Honesty** about the situation\n- **Respect** for all parties involved\n- **Agency** for everyone to make their own choices\n\nIf any of these are missing, it's not ENM—it's just non-monogamy (at best) or cheating/manipulation (at worst).\n\n---\n\n## 10 Green Flags of Genuine ENM\n\n### 1. Everyone Affected Knows and Consents\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Partners are aware of other relationships\n- New people know about existing partners\n- Nobody is being kept secret\n- Consent is ongoing, not one-time\n\n**Why it matters:**\nWithout informed consent, there's no \"ethical\" in ethical non-monogamy.\n\n### 2. Rules Apply Equally\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Both/all partners have similar freedoms\n- Nobody has more dating privileges than others\n- Restrictions are mutual, not one-sided\n- Everyone agreed to the structure\n\n**Why it matters:**\nOne-sided arrangements often benefit one person while restricting another.\n\n### 3. Partners Speak Positively About Each Other\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- They describe partners with respect\n- Acknowledge metamours exist without resentment\n- Don't badmouth other relationships\n- Show genuine care for all partners\n\n**Why it matters:**\nHow they talk about partners predicts how they'll treat you.\n\n### 4. They Communicate Proactively\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Share relevant information without being asked\n- Discuss changes before they happen\n- Check in regularly about how things are going\n- Don't hide important details\n\n**Why it matters:**\nGood ENM requires active communication, not secrets.\n\n### 5. Boundaries Are Respected\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- No means no, without negotiation\n- They honor agreements they've made\n- Boundaries evolve through conversation, not violation\n- They respect your autonomy\n\n**Why it matters:**\nBoundary respect in small things predicts respect in big things.\n\n### 6. New Relationships Have a Path Forward\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- You can have real relationship, not just sex\n- Potential for emotional connection exists\n- You're not permanently \"less than\"\n- Growth is possible\n\n**Why it matters:**\nEthical means treating people as people, not as accessories.\n\n### 7. They've Done the Work\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Read books, had conversations\n- Can articulate their structure\n- Understand common ENM concepts\n- Continue learning and growing\n\n**Why it matters:**\nENM without education often fails or harms people.\n\n### 8. Jealousy Is Acknowledged, Not Weaponized\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- They admit when they feel jealous\n- Work through feelings rather than projecting\n- Don't use jealousy to control others\n- Take responsibility for their emotions\n\n**Why it matters:**\nJealousy is normal; using it to manipulate isn't.\n\n### 9. All Partners Have Voice in Decisions\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Rules that affect you were negotiated with you\n- You can renegotiate things that aren't working\n- Your needs are considered, not just theirs\n- Power is reasonably balanced\n\n**Why it matters:**\nOne-sided rule-making isn't ethical.\n\n### 10. The Relationship Could Work Long-Term\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Structure is sustainable\n- Not built on someone sacrificing indefinitely\n- Everyone's needs can reasonably be met\n- There's a path to stability\n\n**Why it matters:**\nSustainable structures indicate genuine ethical intent.\n\n---\n\n## 10 Red Flags That It's Not Actually ENM\n\n### 1. \"My Partner Doesn't Know\"\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Secretive about partner\n- \"It's complicated\" without explanation\n- Asks you to hide your existence\n- Only available at odd times\n\n**Why it's a problem:**\nThis isn't ENM—it's cheating. Run.\n\n### 2. Rules Only Restrict One Person\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- They can date, but partner can't\n- One Penis Policy (she can see women, not men)\n- They have veto power over you but not vice versa\n- Double standards everywhere\n\n**Why it's a problem:**\nOne-sided arrangements often mask insecurity or control.\n\n### 3. You're Asked to Be a Secret\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Can't acknowledge you publicly\n- Partner doesn't know about you\n- You're hidden on social media\n- Can't be mentioned to friends\n\n**Why it's a problem:**\nIf you're a secret, you're not in an ethical relationship.\n\n### 4. They Trash Talk Partners\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Constant complaints about partner\n- Disparaging remarks about metamours\n- Playing you against others\n- Creating drama between relationships\n\n**Why it's a problem:**\nThey'll talk about you this way to others.\n\n### 5. Consent Was Coerced\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Partner agreed under pressure\n- \"This or we break up\" ultimatums\n- Consent came during crisis\n- One person clearly unhappy with arrangement\n\n**Why it's a problem:**\nCoerced consent isn't consent.\n\n### 6. You're Treated as Less-Than\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Called \"secondary\" pejoratively\n- Permanent limits on relationship potential\n- Your needs always come last\n- Disposable when inconvenient\n\n**Why it's a problem:**\nEthical means treating people as full humans.\n\n### 7. Rules Change Without Discussion\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- New restrictions appear suddenly\n- Agreements made aren't kept\n- Goalposts constantly move\n- Your input isn't sought\n\n**Why it's a problem:**\nUnilateral rule changes violate consent.\n\n### 8. They Avoid Accountability\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Deflect when called out\n- Blame others for their choices\n- Never apologize meaningfully\n- Don't change after harm\n\n**Why it's a problem:**\nWithout accountability, harm repeats.\n\n### 9. \"Ethical\" Is Just a Label\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Say they're ENM but don't act like it\n- Use terminology without understanding\n- Don't actually follow ENM principles\n- It's branding, not practice\n\n**Why it's a problem:**\nLabels without substance are manipulation.\n\n### 10. Your Gut Says Something's Wrong\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Can't articulate it but feel uneasy\n- Things don't quite add up\n- Questions get deflected\n- Explanations don't satisfy\n\n**Why it's a problem:**\nIntuition often catches what logic misses.\n\n---\n\n## Questions to Ask to Find Out\n\n### About Their Partners\n\n> \"Does your partner know you're on here? Are they supportive?\"\n\n> \"How do your partners feel about you dating?\"\n\n> \"Could I meet your partner at some point, or is that not part of how you structure things?\"\n\n### About Structure\n\n> \"What does your ENM setup look like?\"\n\n> \"Do you and your partners have similar freedoms?\"\n\n> \"What rules or agreements do you have that would affect me?\"\n\n### About You\n\n> \"What kind of relationship could this become?\"\n\n> \"Would I have input on decisions that affect me?\"\n\n> \"What happens if I develop deeper feelings?\"\n\n---\n\n## When You Discover It's Not ENM\n\n### If You're Just Talking\n\nEnd the conversation:\n> \"Based on what you've described, this isn't something I can be part of. I only engage in genuinely ethical non-monogamy.\"\n\n### If You're Already Involved\n\nYou have choices:\n- End the connection\n- Ask them to change (and decide if you believe they will)\n- Accept the situation (but stop calling it ENM)\n\n### The Hard Truth\n\nYou can't make someone's non-monogamy ethical. You can only decide whether to participate in what they're offering.\n\n---\n\n## Protecting Yourself\n\n### Early Vetting\n\nAsk questions before investing:\n- About partners and their awareness\n- About structure and rules\n- About what this could become\n\n### Trust Patterns, Not Promises\n\nWatch:\n- How they treat partners you can observe\n- Whether actions match words\n- How they handle small tests of honesty\n\n### Know Your Limits\n\nDecide in advance:\n- What red flags you won't tolerate\n- When you'll walk away\n- What ethical means to you\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [ENM Etiquette 101](/enm-communication/enm-etiquette-guide)\n- [The \"Am I Ready for ENM?\" Checklist](/enm-communication/enm-readiness-checklist)\n- [Avoiding Unicorn Hunting](/enm-communication/avoid-unicorn-hunting)\n- [Feeld Chat Red Flags](/feeld-guide/feeld-chat-red-flags)\n\n---\n\n## Choose Genuinely Ethical Connections\n\nReal ENM requires communication, honesty, and mutual respect.
