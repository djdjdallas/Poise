Some people swear by detailed agreements; others advocate for minimal structure. The truth is that the right amount of rules depends on the people involved, where they are in their journey, and what they need to feel secure.\n\nThis guide breaks down the differences between rules, boundaries, and agreements; explores common rules across different categories; and helps you figure out what might work for your relationship.\n\n---\n\n## Rules vs. Boundaries vs. Agreements: What's the Difference?\n\nThese terms often get used interchangeably, but they mean different things—and the distinction matters.\n\n### Rules\n\n**Definition:** Rules are restrictions you place on your partner's behavior. They're \"You can't\" or \"You must\" statements.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"You can't sleep with anyone without telling me first\"\n- \"You must use protection with other partners\"\n- \"You can't see the same person more than twice a month\"\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- External enforcement (you're controlling someone else's actions)\n- Usually come with consequences if broken\n- Often motivated by fear or insecurity\n- Can feel restrictive to the person following them\n\n### Boundaries\n\n**Definition:** Boundaries are limits you place on your own behavior and what you'll accept in your life. They're \"I will\" or \"I won't\" statements.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"I won't continue a relationship where I don't know about other partners\"\n- \"I need 24 hours notice before you bring someone to our home\"\n- \"I don't share sexual health information about my other partners\"\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Internal enforcement (you control your own actions and responses)\n- About what you need, not what you're demanding from others\n- Often feel more empowering and less controlling\n- Others can choose to respect them or not; you choose what to do about it\n\n### Agreements\n\n**Definition:** Agreements are mutually negotiated understandings between partners. They're \"We will\" or \"We won't\" statements that both people actively consent to.\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"We'll tell each other when a connection is becoming serious\"\n- \"We won't date within our friend group\"\n- \"We'll check in every Sunday about how we're feeling\"\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Collaborative creation\n- Both partners have ownership\n- Can be renegotiated as circumstances change\n- Built on mutual consent rather than unilateral demands\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nMany ENM conflicts come from treating one of these as another.\n\nA rule that's really someone's boundary gets enforced externally when it should be owned personally. An agreement that was never truly mutual feels unfair to the partner who didn't really choose it.\n\nWhen you're discussing structure in your relationship, be clear about which category you're in:\n- Is this something I need for myself (boundary)?\n- Is this something I'm asking you to do (rule)?\n- Is this something we're deciding together (agreement)?\n\n---\n\n## 20 Common Rules by Category\n\nHere are rules and agreements commonly used in open relationships, organized by what they address. These aren't recommendations—they're options to consider and discuss.\n\n### Communication Rules\n\n**1. Disclosure Timing**\n> \"We tell each other about new connections before becoming sexually involved.\"\n\nThis addresses the need to know what's happening. Variations include telling after the first kiss, after the first date, or simply before the next time you see each other.\n\n**2. Detail Level**\n> \"We share that dates happened and give a general sense of how it went, but we don't need play-by-play details.\"\n\nSome couples want full disclosure; others prefer less information. Getting clear on this prevents both over-sharing that triggers jealousy and under-sharing that feels like secrecy.\n\n**3. Veto Communication**\n> \"Either of us can express concerns about a connection, and we commit to discussing it seriously.\"\n\nNote this is about discussing, not automatically ending things. More on veto specifically later.\n\n**4. Advance Notice**\n> \"We give each other 24-48 hours notice before a date, not as permission, but as courtesy.\"\n\nThis helps with logistics and emotional preparation without requiring \"approval.\"\n\n**5. Check-in Rhythms**\n> \"We have a weekly check-in conversation about how we're each feeling about our open relationship.\"\n\nRegular structured conversations prevent resentment from building up unaddressed.\n\n### Physical/Sexual Rules\n\n**6. Barrier Use**\n> \"We use barriers (condoms/dental dams) for all sexual contact with other partners.\"\n\nThis is one of the most common agreements, usually linked to sexual health conversations.\n\n**7. Testing Cadence**\n> \"We get STI tested every three months and share results with each other.\"\n\nRegular testing with clear communication about results is a foundation of many ENM relationships.\n\n**8. Fluid Bonding**\n> \"Barrier-free sex is reserved for our primary relationship until we explicitly renegotiate.\"\n\nSome couples choose to maintain certain physical activities as exclusive, even as they open other aspects.\n\n**9. Location Limits**\n> \"We don't bring other partners to our home\" or \"We don't have sex in our shared bed.\"\n\nFor some, physical spaces hold emotional significance that they want to protect.\n\n**10. Activity Limits**\n> \"Certain sexual activities are reserved for our relationship.\"\n\nThis might be specific acts, or it might be categories like \"overnights\" or \"vacation travel.\"\n\n### Time and Availability Rules\n\n**11. Date Frequency**\n> \"We limit outside dating to two nights per week maximum.\"\n\nThis ensures the primary relationship gets adequate attention.\n\n**12. Protected Time**\n> \"Saturday nights are always ours, no outside dates.\"\n\nDesignating specific time as couple-only creates predictability and security.\n\n**13. Event Priority**\n> \"Major events (anniversaries, family functions, partner's important days) take priority over other dates.\"\n\nThis establishes hierarchy of commitment without restricting day-to-day dating.\n\n**14. Response Expectations**\n> \"When one of us is on a date, we're not expected to be available for texting, but we check in at least once.\"\n\nBalancing presence with other partners versus connection with each other.\n\n**15. New Relationship Energy Management**\n> \"When one of us is in NRE, we commit to actively maintaining our couple time even when it's tempting to spend all free time with the new person.\"\n\nNRE can be overwhelming; this builds in protection for existing relationships.\n\n### Relationship Escalator Rules\n\n**16. No Nesting**\n> \"We won't move in with or share finances with other partners.\"\n\nThis establishes limits on how far other relationships can escalate.\n\n**17. No Pregnancy**\n> \"We take every precaution against pregnancy with other partners.\"\n\nFor couples who want to keep family planning within their relationship.\n\n**18. Hierarchy Acknowledgment**\n> \"Our relationship is primary, and decisions about major life stuff (moving, career changes, big purchases) center our partnership first.\"\n\nThis makes hierarchy explicit rather than assumed.\n\n**19. No Relationship Labels**\n> \"Other connections can't use titles like 'boyfriend/girlfriend' that suggest a committed relationship.\"\n\nFor some, labels carry emotional weight they want to reserve.\n\n**20. Meeting Meta Partners**\n> \"We meet serious partners after X dates\" or \"We never meet each other's partners unless everyone wants to.\"\n\nThis can go either direction depending on your preferred style (kitchen table vs. parallel poly).\n\n### Digital and Social Rules\n\n**Bonus: Profile Visibility**\n> \"We can see each other's dating app profiles if we want\" or \"We maintain privacy around our dating apps.\"\n\n**Bonus: Social Media Boundaries**\n> \"We don't post about other partners on shared social media\" or \"We're fully out and share openly.\"\n\n**Bonus: Shared Networks**\n> \"We don't date within our close friend group\" or \"Dating friends is fine but requires extra conversation.\"\n\n---\n\n## How to Establish Rules That Work\n\nHaving a list of possible rules is one thing. Actually agreeing on them with a partner is another.\n\n### Start with Needs, Not Rules\n\nInstead of opening with \"I want a rule that...\", start with \"I need...\" or \"I feel secure when...\"\n\nFor example:\n- Instead of: \"I want a rule that you text me every hour when you're on a date\"\n- Try: \"I feel anxious when I don't know what's happening. I need some kind of check-in to feel grounded.\"\n\nStarting with needs invites collaboration. Starting with rules invites negotiation (or resentment).\n\n### Explain the Why\n\nEvery rule should have a reason. If you can't articulate why you need something, sit with it before proposing it.\n\nGood why's:\n- \"This helps me manage jealousy while I build security\"\n- \"This protects our shared sexual health\"\n- \"This ensures our relationship gets the time it needs\"\n\nProblematic why's:\n- \"Because I said so\"\n- \"Because it's just what you do\"\n- \"Because I don't trust you\"\n\nIf the reason is distrust, the rule probably isn't the real solution.\n\n### Make Them Specific\n\nVague rules lead to conflict because partners interpret them differently.\n\n**Vague:** \"Be safe\"\n**Specific:** \"Use barriers for penetrative sex; get tested quarterly; tell me if something happens that affects our shared sexual health\"\n\n**Vague:** \"Tell me about your dates\"\n**Specific:** \"Tell me before a first date happens, and give me a general temperature check after—good/bad/maybe—without details unless I ask\"\n\n### Build in Review Points\n\nRules that made sense at the beginning might not make sense a year later. Build in explicit times to revisit and renegotiate.\n\n> \"We'll revisit our agreements at our quarterly check-in\"\n> \"This rule is in place for the first six months while we build experience, then we'll reassess\"\n> \"Either of us can request a conversation about any rule at any time\"\n\n### Agree on Consequences\n\nWhat happens if a rule is broken? This isn't about punishment—it's about understanding what a breach means for the relationship.\n\nSome couples explicitly agree that certain breaches end the relationship. Others agree that breaches require a processing conversation and potentially a pause on outside dating while trust is rebuilt. Others prefer not to specify in advance.\n\nWhatever you choose, having some shared understanding prevents the conversation after a breach from being even harder.\n\n---\n\n## Rules That Often Backfire\n\nSome rules sound good in theory but tend to create problems in practice. Here are patterns to watch for.\n\n### The Veto\n\n**The rule:** \"Either of us can veto each other's partners at any time, for any reason.\"\n\n**Why it backfires:** Veto rules often create triangulation and resentment. The partner using the veto feels powerful but often unclear about what they're actually uncomfortable with. The partner being vetoed feels controlled. The outside person gets treated as disposable without agency.\n\n**Better alternative:** Agreement to discuss concerns seriously, with a commitment to understand what's really happening. Sometimes a veto impulse is pointing at something real; often it's about the couple's relationship rather than the outside person.\n\n### The \"No Feelings\" Rule\n\n**The rule:** \"Other relationships can only be physical, no emotional involvement allowed.\"\n\n**Why it backfires:** Feelings aren't actually controllable. This rule sets people up to either suppress natural human connection or to lie about what's developing. It also tends to devalue other partners in ways that feel dehumanizing.\n\n**Better alternative:** Agreement about what you'll do if feelings develop—how you'll communicate, what adjustments you'll consider, how you'll prioritize.\n\n### The \"One Penis Policy\"\n\n**The rule:** (For heterosexual couples) \"She can only see other women, not other men.\"\n\n**Why it backfires:** Often rooted in the assumption that relationships with women are less threatening, which is homophobic and devalues queer relationships. Usually about male insecurity rather than genuine ethical concern. Creates an unequal structure that breeds resentment.\n\n**Better alternative:** Examine why this asymmetry feels necessary. Work on the underlying insecurity. Create rules that apply equally regardless of gender.\n\n### Excessive Detail Requirements\n\n**The rule:** \"Tell me everything—every text, every kiss, every feeling you have about other people.\"\n\n**Why it backfires:** This level of detail often creates more jealousy, not less. It can become a compulsive need that never feels like enough. It also invades the privacy of the other partner's relationships.\n\n**Better alternative:** Figure out what information actually helps you feel secure versus what feeds anxiety. Often less is more.\n\n### The \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" Rule\n\n**The rule:** \"We can each do what we want as long as the other person doesn't have to know about it.\"\n\n**Why it backfires:** Creates secrecy rather than openness. Makes it impossible to build genuine security because there's always unknown territory. Often leads to discoveries that feel like betrayal because there was no framework for honesty.\n\n**Better alternative:** Some version of disclosure, even if minimal. \"I was out with someone last night\" can be enough without requiring details.\n\n---\n\n## When Rules Get Broken\n\nEven with good intentions and clear agreements, breaches happen. How you handle them matters more than the breach itself.\n\n### Pause Before Reacting\n\nFinding out a rule was broken triggers strong emotions. Before having the conversation, give yourself time to move through the initial reaction.\n\n### Understand Before Judging\n\nWas this a misunderstanding about the rule? A moment of weakness with immediate disclosure? Deliberate deception over time? These are different situations requiring different responses.\n\n### Separate the Rule from the Relationship\n\nA broken rule isn't automatically a broken relationship. Ask:\n- Was this a one-time lapse or a pattern?\n- Did they disclose or hide?\n- What do they seem to feel about it?\n- Is the underlying relationship still sound?\n\n### Examine the Rule Itself\n\nSometimes a broken rule reveals that the rule wasn't realistic or fair. This doesn't excuse the breach, but it's information for future agreements.\n\n### Decide What You Need to Move Forward\n\nThis might be:\n- A sincere apology and commitment to the agreement\n- Pausing outside dating while you rebuild trust\n- Renegotiating the rule with more realistic terms\n- Therapy or structured support to process\n- Ending the relationship\n\nThere's no universal right answer. What matters is being honest about what you actually need.\n\n---\n\n## A Framework for New Couples Opening Up\n\nIf you're just starting your open relationship journey, here's a suggested framework:\n\n### Start Minimal\n\nResist the urge to create elaborate rule structures. Start with:\n1. One agreement about disclosure\n2. One agreement about safer sex\n3. One agreement about time/availability\n4. A commitment to regular check-ins\n\n### Add Based on Experience\n\nAs you actually start dating others, you'll discover what triggers concern and what feels fine. Add agreements based on real needs that emerge, not theoretical worries.\n\n### Expect to Renegotiate\n\nYour first agreements are drafts. You'll learn more about yourselves and each other as you go. Build in the expectation that things will change.\n\n### Err Toward Security Early\n\nIn the beginning, when you're building new muscles, it's okay to have more structure. As you build trust and experience, you can loosen things up. It's harder to add restrictions later than to gradually relax them.\n\n---\n\n## A Framework for Experienced Couples Reassessing\n\nIf you've been ENM for a while and are examining your existing agreements:\n\n### Audit What Actually Happens\n\nWhat rules do you have that you don't actually follow? What informal patterns have developed that aren't formally agreed upon? What agreements feel outdated?\n\n### Check for Fairness\n\nDo your rules apply equally? Are they based on current needs or historical fears? Is anyone feeling controlled or resentful?\n\n### Streamline\n\nOften long-standing couples have accumulated rules that no longer serve them. Consider which agreements are still necessary and which can be retired.\n\n### Address the Elephant in the Room\n\nAre there tensions you've been avoiding by keeping restrictive rules in place? Sometimes rules are proxies for conversations you haven't had.\n\n---\n\n## Rules Don't Replace Trust\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: no amount of rules can protect you from a partner who wants to violate them.\n\nRules work when both people genuinely consent to them and are committed to honoring them. They don't work as cage bars keeping someone in who wants out.\n\nIf you find yourself wanting to add more and more rules, or checking up on whether rules are being followed, or feeling like the rules are the only thing holding things together—that's information about the relationship, not about the rules.\n\nThe goal isn't a comprehensive rulebook. It's a shared understanding between people who trust each other and want the same things.\n\nRules are scaffolding for trust, not substitutes for it.\n\n---\n\n## Having Ongoing Conversations\n\nRules aren't set-and-forget. They're living agreements that need tending. Here's how to keep the conversation going.\n\n**Scheduled Check-ins:** Monthly or quarterly conversations specifically about how your agreements are working.\n\n**Request for Renegotiation:** Either partner can ask to discuss any rule at any time. The request alone isn't an accusation—it's an invitation to evolve together.\n\n**Post-Situation Processing:** After significant events (new partners, near-breaches, jealousy flares), talk about whether your agreements need adjustment.\n\n**Anniversary Reviews:** Once a year, do a comprehensive review of your entire agreement structure.\n\nThe couples who thrive in ENM are the ones who keep talking—not because things are wrong, but because things are always changing.\n\n---\n\n## Finding Your Own Way\n\nEvery relationship is different. The rules that work for one couple might feel suffocating to another and inadequate to a third.\n\nWhat matters is that your agreements:\n- Are genuinely mutual (not one person's demands)\n- Address real needs (not theoretical fears)\n- Get revisited over time (not set in stone)\n- Feel fair to everyone involved (not asymmetric)\n- Support connection (not just manage risk)\n\nYou're building something custom. Use frameworks like this one as starting points, but trust your own experience about what actually works for you.\n\n---\n\n## Need Help With the Conversation?\n\nNegotiating rules and agreements with partners can be one of the hardest conversations in ENM. Finding the right words for what you need, especially in charged emotional moments, isn't always easy.\n\nPoise helps you articulate what you're thinking and feeling in relationship conversations.
