    "raw": "\nYou've matched with someone interesting. The conversation is going well. But you've never met in person. How do you know if you can trust them enough to actually meet?\n\nHere's how to build genuine trust through messaging—so you can meet with confidence.\n\n---\n\n## What Trust Means Before Meeting\n\n### What You're Assessing\n\nBefore meeting, you want to know:\n- Are they who they say they are?\n- Do they seem safe?\n- Is there genuine interest, not just games?\n- Will they respect my boundaries?\n- Is this worth my time and vulnerability?\n\n### What Trust Is (and Isn't)\n\n**Trust is:**\n- Reasonable confidence based on available information\n- A gut feeling supported by evidence\n- Built gradually through interaction\n- Always somewhat uncertain (you can't know fully until you meet)\n\n**Trust isn't:**\n- Absolute certainty (impossible before meeting)\n- Ignoring red flags because you want it to work\n- Moving forward when something feels wrong\n- Achieved through a single conversation\n\n---\n\n## How Trust Builds Through Messaging\n\n### Consistency\n\n**What to notice:**\n- Do their stories match over time?\n- Does their communication style stay consistent?\n- Do they follow through on what they say?\n- Is their profile consistent with their messages?\n\n**Trust builder:** When what they say matches what they do, and it stays consistent.\n\n### Transparency\n\n**What to notice:**\n- Do they answer questions directly?\n- Are they open about relevant things (relationship status, what they're looking for)?\n- Do they share about themselves without you having to extract information?\n- Are they forthcoming when you ask follow-up questions?\n\n**Trust builder:** Openness and willingness to share.\n\n### Reciprocity\n\n**What to notice:**\n- Do they show interest in you, or just talk about themselves?\n- Do they ask questions and remember your answers?\n- Is the effort balanced?\n- Do they share at similar levels to what you share?\n\n**Trust builder:** Mutual investment in the conversation.\n\n### Respect for Boundaries\n\n**What to notice:**\n- How do they respond when you set a boundary?\n- Do they push when you say no?\n- Do they respect your communication preferences?\n- Do they accept your pace?\n\n**Trust builder:** Boundaries are honored without pushback or resentment.\n\n---\n\n## Specific Trust-Building Practices\n\n### Ask Questions and Notice Answers\n\n**Questions that reveal character:**\n- What are you looking for on here?\n- What's important to you in a connection?\n- How do you handle [relevant topic]?\n- What's your experience been like?\n\n**Notice:**\n- Do they answer genuinely?\n- Does their answer align with your needs?\n- Do they evade or deflect?\n- Is there depth to what they share?\n\n### Share and Notice Response\n\n**When you share something:**\n- Do they listen and remember?\n- Do they respond with care?\n- Does their response build on what you said?\n- Do they meet your vulnerability with their own?\n\n**Trust is built when sharing is received well.**\n\n### Test Small Boundaries\n\n**Not as manipulation, but as information:**\n- Say you can't talk at a certain time—do they respect it?\n- Express a preference—do they accommodate?\n- Share a limit—do they push against it?\n\n**Their response to small boundaries predicts response to bigger ones.**\n\n### Video Call Before Meeting\n\n**Why it helps:**\n- Confirms they look like their photos\n- See if conversation translates to real-time\n- Get a better sense of their vibe\n- Assess safety in a lower-risk environment\n\n**How to suggest:**\n> \"I'd love to video chat before we meet in person—it helps me feel more comfortable. Would you be up for that?\"\n\n---\n\n## Red Flags That Erode Trust\n\n### Inconsistency\n\n- Stories that don't add up\n- Saying one thing, doing another\n- Changing their story over time\n- Behavior that doesn't match words\n\n### Pressure\n\n- Pushing to meet before you're ready\n- Getting frustrated with your pace\n- Guilting you for boundaries\n- Moving faster than you're comfortable\n\n### Evasiveness\n\n- Dodging direct questions\n- Being vague about basic things\n- Won't verify identity (video call, etc.)\n- Seems to be hiding something\n\n### Disrespect\n\n- Ignoring what you've said\n- Forgetting things you've shared\n- Making you feel bad for having needs\n- Treating your concerns as unimportant\n\n### Lovebombing\n\n- Excessive intensity too early\n- Declaring strong feelings before really knowing you\n- Trying to create artificial intimacy\n- Moving emotionally faster than makes sense\n\n---\n\n## Trust-Building Conversation Examples\n\n### Early Conversation\n\n**You:** \"What brings you to Feeld?\"\n**Them:** \"I've been poly for a couple years and I'm looking to meet new people. I'm especially interested in connections with good conversation. What about you?\"\n\n**Trust signal:** Direct answer, shares about themselves, asks about you.\n\n### After Some Conversation\n\n**You:** \"Before we meet, I'd love to do a video call. Is that something you'd be open to?\"\n**Them:** \"Totally makes sense—I appreciate that you're thoughtful about this. How about tomorrow evening?\"\n\n**Trust signal:** Respects the boundary, accommodates, no pushback.\n\n### When You Share Something\n\n**You:** \"I'm a little nervous about meeting people from apps. Past experiences and all.\"\n**Them:** \"That's completely understandable. What would help you feel more comfortable? I'm happy to go at your pace.\"\n\n**Trust signal:** Validates concern, offers accommodation, puts your comfort first.\n\n---\n\n## Trusting Your Gut\n\n### The Gut Is Data\n\nYour intuition picks up on patterns your conscious mind might miss. If something feels off, pay attention.\n\n**Gut feelings worth heeding:**\n- \"Something about this doesn't add up\"\n- \"They're saying the right things but it doesn't feel right\"\n- \"I feel uncomfortable but can't articulate why\"\n- \"This feels too good to be true\"\n\n### When Gut and Logic Conflict\n\nIf everything seems fine on paper but you feel uneasy:\n- Take more time\n- Ask more questions\n- Try video calling\n- Discuss your concern with a trusted friend\n\nYou don't need to justify your discomfort. It's valid data.\n\n### Overriding Your Gut\n\nBe cautious if you find yourself:\n- Talking yourself into trusting someone\n- Ignoring warning signs because you like them\n- Making excuses for concerning behavior\n- Wanting it to work so badly that you overlook issues\n\n---\n\n## How Much Trust Is Enough?\n\n### Before First Meeting\n\n**Sufficient trust:**\n- Reasonable confidence they're who they say\n- No major red flags\n- They've respected your boundaries so far\n- Your gut feels okay (nervous is fine; alarmed is not)\n\n**Not required:**\n- Absolute certainty\n- Full knowledge of who they are\n- Complete absence of nervousness\n- Guarantee the date will be great\n\n### First Meeting as Additional Assessment\n\nThe first meeting is another step in building trust, not the end point:\n- Meet in public\n- Have your own transportation\n- Tell someone where you are\n- Keep phone charged and accessible\n- Be willing to leave if something feels wrong\n\n**You can meet someone and decide not to see them again.** The first meeting isn't a commitment.\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**How long should I message before meeting?**\nEnough to have some real conversation and assess basic compatibility/safety. For some people that's a few days; for others it's longer. Go at your pace.\n\n**What if they pressure me to meet before I'm ready?**\nThat's a red flag. Someone who can't respect your timing probably won't respect other boundaries either.\n\n**Can you ever really trust someone you met online?**\nYes, but trust builds gradually through experience, not through messages alone. Meeting is the next step in trust-building.\n\n**What if I trust too easily?**\nWork on slowing down and letting trust build over time. Notice patterns. Get outside perspectives. Trust should be earned, not given freely.\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [The Role of Vulnerability in Dating](/authentic-connection/vulnerability-in-dating-guide)\n- [How to Ask Someone to Meet Up on Feeld](/feeld-guide/feeld-ask-to-meet)\n- [Dating After Relationship Trauma](/dating-confidence/dating-after-trauma)\n\n---\n\n## Trust Is Built, Not Given\n\nReal trust develops through interaction, consistency, and time.
