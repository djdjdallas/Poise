    "raw": "\nYour partner met someone new. At first, you were supportive—maybe even excited for them. But now something's shifted. They're texting constantly. They light up at mentions of this person. Meanwhile, you're feeling... replaced. Like you've become the background character in your own relationship.\n\nThis feeling is one of the most painful experiences in polyamory. Let's understand it and work through it.\n\n## What \"Feeling Replaced\" Actually Is\n\nWhen you feel replaced, you're usually experiencing some combination of:\n\n**Loss of attention**: Your partner's focus has visibly shifted\n**Loss of priority**: Plans, time, and energy are going elsewhere\n**Loss of specialness**: Things that felt unique to your relationship are being shared\n**Fear of obsolescence**: Worry that you're becoming unnecessary\n**Grief**: Mourning a relationship dynamic that's changing\n\nThese are real feelings about real changes. Dismissing them as \"just jealousy\" doesn't help.\n\n## Is It NRE or Something More?\n\nNew Relationship Energy (NRE) naturally pulls attention toward new connections. This is normal and usually temporary. But sometimes what feels like NRE is actually your partner deprioritizing you.\n\n### Signs It's Probably NRE:\n\n- Your partner is aware of the imbalance and working on it\n- They make genuine efforts to maintain your connection\n- The intensity has a temporary quality\n- Your fundamental agreements are still being honored\n- They check in about how you're doing\n\n### Signs It Might Be More Than NRE:\n\n- Your needs are consistently dismissed or deferred\n- Quality time is promised but not delivered\n- Your partner gets defensive when you raise concerns\n- Agreements are being broken or bent without discussion\n- You feel like an afterthought, not just competing with excitement\n\nThe difference matters because the solutions differ.\n\n## Step 1: Name What You're Experiencing\n\nGet specific about what's happening and how it affects you:\n\n**The facts** (observable, not interpretations):\n- \"We used to have date nights twice a week. Now it's been three weeks.\"\n- \"Our morning texts have stopped.\"\n- \"When we're together, they're often on their phone texting [person].\"\n\n**Your feelings**:\n- \"I feel invisible.\"\n- \"I'm scared I'm losing you.\"\n- \"I feel like I'm not enough.\"\n\n**Your needs**:\n- \"I need quality time that's actually present.\"\n- \"I need to feel prioritized.\"\n- \"I need reassurance that I matter.\"\n\nThis clarity helps you communicate and helps your partner understand.\n\n## Step 2: Check Your Stories\n\nOur brains create narratives that aren't always accurate. Common stories when feeling replaced:\n\n**\"They like them better than me.\"**\nMaybe. Or maybe NRE is biochemically powerful and you're misreading temporary intensity as comparative judgment.\n\n**\"They're going to leave me for this person.\"**\nPossible, but most polyamorous relationships don't work this way. New doesn't mean replacement.\n\n**\"I'm not enough.\"**\nYour worth isn't determined by being someone's sole focus. And wanting attention isn't evidence of inadequacy.\n\n**\"This is how it will always be now.\"**\nNRE fades. Relationships rebalance. Current state isn't permanent state.\n\nNotice your stories. Ask yourself: What evidence supports this? What evidence contradicts it?\n\n## Step 3: Self-Soothe Before Communicating\n\nComing to your partner from desperation or accusation rarely goes well. Before the conversation:\n\n**Ground yourself physically**: Exercise, sleep, eat. Don't communicate from a depleted state.\n\n**Process with trusted others**: Friends, therapists, or community who understand ENM.\n\n**Remember your worth**: List things you value about yourself independent of this relationship.\n\n**Recall relationship history**: What evidence exists that your partner values you?\n\nYou're not suppressing feelings—you're regulating enough to communicate effectively.\n\n## Step 4: Have the Conversation\n\nWhen you're ready:\n\n### Open with connection, not accusation\n\n> \"I want to talk about something important. I love you and I want our relationship to thrive. I've been struggling, and I want to share what's going on for me.\"\n\n### Share using \"I\" statements\n\n> \"I've been feeling disconnected from you lately. When we don't have our usual time together, I start feeling scared that I'm losing my place in your life.\"\n\nNot:\n\n> \"You never have time for me anymore. You're always with [person].\"\n\n### Be specific about what you need\n\n> \"I need us to reinstate our weekly date nights—actually protected time, not just in theory. I need you to be present when we're together, not on your phone. I need some reassurance that this relationship still matters to you.\"\n\n### Ask, don't demand\n\n> \"Is this something you can work on with me? What do you need from me to make this possible?\"\n\n## What Your Partner Might Say\n\n### \"I didn't realize you were feeling this way.\"\n\nThis is actually good—it means they're not intentionally neglecting you. Follow up with specifics about what would help.\n\n### \"I think you're being insecure.\"\n\nThis is dismissive. Push back:\n\n> \"Insecurity might be part of it, and I'm working on that. But my feelings are also a response to real changes in our relationship. Can we focus on what we can do together?\"\n\n### \"I need time with [person] too.\"\n\nThis is valid. You're not asking for them to stop seeing someone else:\n\n> \"Absolutely. I'm not asking you to stop seeing them. I'm asking for our relationship to be maintained, not for theirs to end.\"\n\n### \"I feel pulled in too many directions.\"\n\nThis is honest and worth exploring:\n\n> \"I appreciate you telling me that. Let's figure out what's sustainable. What support do you need?\"\n\n## Rebuilding Connection\n\nAfter the conversation, the work begins:\n\n### Scheduled, protected time\n\nPut dates on the calendar. Don't let them be the thing that gets canceled when life gets busy.\n\n### Quality matters more than quantity\n\nThree hours of present, attentive time beats eight hours of distracted togetherness.\n\n### Rituals and anchors\n\nWhat consistent touchpoints can you maintain?\n- Morning texts\n- Goodnight calls\n- Weekly check-ins\n- Monthly overnight dates\n\n### Repair when things slip\n\nPerfection isn't the goal. When NRE causes wobbles (and it will), acknowledge and repair quickly.\n\n## Working on Your Side\n\nWhile your partner works on theirs, you have work too:\n\n### Build independent security\n\nDon't make your sense of worth entirely dependent on your partner's attention. Cultivate:\n- Friendships\n- Personal interests\n- Professional satisfaction\n- Self-relationship\n\n### Practice self-soothing\n\nWhen anxious feelings arise:\n- Physical grounding (5-4-3-2-1 senses exercise)\n- Reach out to friends\n- Journal the feelings\n- Remind yourself of evidence that you're valued\n\n### Examine your attachment\n\nIf feeling replaced triggers intense distress that doesn't match the situation, attachment work might help:\n- Read about attachment styles\n- Consider therapy\n- Practice sitting with discomfort\n\n### Appreciate what you have\n\nGratitude isn't toxic positivity—it's balance. What's still good? What evidence exists of your partner's love?\n\n## Red Lines: When Feeling Replaced Is Actually Being Replaced\n\nSometimes you're not overreacting. Sometimes you're being genuinely deprioritized:\n\n### Warning signs:\n\n- Multiple conversations with no change\n- Promises made and repeatedly broken\n- Dismissal of your feelings as \"your problem\"\n- Consistent choosing of the new person over agreements with you\n- No effort to repair or reconnect\n\n### If this is happening:\n\n- Get very explicit about what you need\n- Set clear timeframes for change\n- Consider couples counseling\n- Evaluate whether this relationship is working for you\n\nYou deserve a partner who values you. If they've truly replaced you, you need to know that and respond accordingly.\n\n## The Long View\n\nNRE typically lasts 6-18 months. Relationships rebalance. What feels catastrophic now often stabilizes.\n\nBut \"wait it out\" only works if:\n- Your partner is aware and making effort\n- Your fundamental needs are being met\n- The relationship is still nourishing overall\n- You're not sacrificing your wellbeing indefinitely\n\nPatience is a virtue. Being a doormat is not.\n\n## For the Partner with NRE\n\nIf you're reading this because your partner sent it to you:\n\n- This isn't an attack. It's a request to be seen.\n- NRE is real and powerful. It's also your responsibility to manage.\n- Your existing partner isn't being unreasonable by wanting maintained connection.\n- Small, consistent gestures matter more than grand occasional ones.\n- Your new relationship doesn't have to diminish—but your existing one can't be neglected either.\n\nBoth relationships can thrive. It takes intention.\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**How long should I wait before saying something?**\nDon't wait until you're resentful. A few weeks of feeling disconnected warrants a conversation.\n\n**What if I've said something and nothing changed?**\nSay it again, more directly. If repeated conversations produce no change, that tells you something.\n\n**Is feeling replaced always about something real?**\nNot always. Sometimes it's attachment triggers without sufficient external cause. But your feelings still deserve attention either way.\n\n**Can I ask my partner to slow down their new relationship?**\nYou can ask, but it's complicated. Asking for your needs to be met is reasonable. Asking them to limit another relationship is usually not.\n\n---\n\nFinding the right words for vulnerable conversations is hard.
