    "raw": "\nYou open Feeld and realize a match is gone. No conversation, no explanation—just disappeared. Or maybe you were mid-conversation and suddenly, poof, they've unmatched.\n\nIt stings. But understanding why it happens can help prevent it—and help you not take it personally.\n\n---\n\n## Common Reasons People Unmatch\n\n### 1. They're Cleaning Up Matches\n\nMany people match liberally and then review later. They might have:\n- Swiped right on everyone to see who matched\n- Changed their mind after looking more closely\n- Realized they're not actually interested\n- Hit match limits and needed to clear space\n\n**What this means:** It's not personal—they're just organizing.\n\n### 2. They Never Intended to Message\n\nSome people match for validation or curiosity, not connection. They enjoy the match notification but don't plan to follow through.\n\n**What this means:** They weren't a good match anyway.\n\n### 3. Your First Message Put Them Off\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes an opener lands wrong:\n- Too sexual too fast\n- Too generic (\"Hey\")\n- Demanding or presumptuous\n- Misread something on their profile\n\n**What this means:** Messaging approach matters. See our [conversation starters guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-conversation-starters).\n\n### 4. They're Coupled and Something Changed\n\nFor partnered users on Feeld, circumstances shift:\n- Their partner got uncomfortable\n- Relationship agreements changed\n- They decided to pause dating\n- Drama with another match affected their activity\n\n**What this means:** Poly/ENM dating has variables beyond your control.\n\n### 5. They Met Someone Else\n\nWhen connections progress, people often clean out other matches. If someone's getting serious with one person, they might unmatch everyone else.\n\n**What this means:** Timing. Not your worth.\n\n### 6. You Said Something That Raised Red Flags\n\nMaybe something in conversation concerned them:\n- Inconsistency in what you shared\n- Pushing past their boundaries\n- Comments that seemed off\n- Asking for too much too fast\n\n**What this means:** Reflect on recent conversations honestly.\n\n### 7. They Deleted the App\n\nPeople take breaks from dating apps. When they delete Feeld, all their matches disappear from your view too.\n\n**What this means:** Literally nothing about you.\n\n### 8. Your Profile Changed\n\nIf you updated photos or bio and something changed their perception:\n- A new photo they didn't connect with\n- Bio changes that felt misaligned\n- Updates that seemed inconsistent\n\n**What this means:** Profile updates can have unintended effects.\n\n---\n\n## Unmatch Timing: What It Reveals\n\n### Unmatched Immediately (Before Messages)\n\nThey swiped right, then looked closer and changed their mind. Common reasons:\n- Profile didn't match their preferences on second look\n- Read your bio more carefully\n- Saw something in photos they initially missed\n- Were swiping carelessly\n\n**Don't take it personally.** Most right-swipes are split-second decisions.\n\n### Unmatched After One Message Exchange\n\nSomething in early conversation put them off:\n- Your opener\n- Your response to their message\n- Different vibes than expected\n- Something in the content\n\n**Consider:** What was the last message? Was anything potentially off-putting?\n\n### Unmatched Mid-Conversation\n\nThis stings more. Possible reasons:\n- They were talking to someone else who became the focus\n- Something in recent messages concerned them\n- Their situation changed\n- They got overwhelmed and cleared their inbox\n\n**Consider:** Was conversation progressing or stalling?\n\n### Unmatched After Making Plans\n\nThe most frustrating. Usually means:\n- They got nervous and bailed\n- Someone or something intervened\n- They found someone else\n- Cold feet about meeting\n\n**Consider:** Not much you could have done differently.\n\n---\n\n## How to Prevent Unmatches\n\n### Have a Strong Profile\n\nProfiles that prevent buyer's remorse:\n- Clear photos that look like you\n- Bio that represents you authentically\n- No misleading information\n- Desires/interests accurately listed\n\nWhen people match knowing what they're getting, they're less likely to unmatch after looking closer.\n\n### Open Well\n\nFirst impressions matter. Good openers:\n- Reference their profile specifically\n- Show genuine interest\n- Avoid being overly sexual (unless they've indicated that's welcome)\n- Demonstrate personality\n\nSee: [30 Feeld Conversation Starters](/feeld-guide/feeld-conversation-starters)\n\n### Move at Their Pace\n\nIf someone:\n- Responds slowly → don't push for faster\n- Gives short answers → don't overwhelm with essays\n- Seems hesitant → don't pressure\n\nMatching someone's energy keeps them comfortable.\n\n### Respect Boundaries\n\nIf they:\n- Don't want to share something → don't push\n- Aren't ready to meet → don't pressure\n- Set a limit → honor it\n\nBoundary violations, even subtle ones, lead to unmatches.\n\n### Progress the Conversation\n\nConversations that stall often end in unmatches. Keep things moving:\n- Ask engaging questions\n- Share about yourself\n- Suggest meeting at appropriate time\n- Don't let conversations become pen-pal situations\n\n### Don't Over-Invest Before Meeting\n\nIf you're devastated by an unmatch from someone you've only exchanged a few messages with, you might be investing too much too early.\n\nKeep perspective. A match is potential, not a relationship.\n\n---\n\n## What to Do When Unmatched\n\n### Don't Obsess Over Why\n\nYou'll probably never know the exact reason. Spending mental energy trying to figure it out is a waste.\n\n### Don't Try to Find Them Again\n\nLooking them up on social media, creating new profiles, or any other attempt to reconnect is not okay. An unmatch is a clear \"no.\"\n\n### Learn What You Can\n\nIf there's an obvious lesson (opener was too aggressive, conversation stalled), take it. If not, move on.\n\n### Move Forward\n\nOne unmatch—or even several—means nothing about your overall dateability. Keep swiping, keep connecting.\n\n---\n\n## The Statistics Perspective\n\nOn any dating app:\n- Most right-swipes never become messages\n- Most conversations never become dates\n- Most dates never become relationships\n- Unmatches are a normal part of the process\n\nIf you're getting a reasonable match rate and some conversations going, unmatches are just part of the noise.\n\n---\n\n## When Unmatching Is Good\n\nSometimes being unmatched is a favor:\n\n### Compatibility Issues\n\nIf they unmatched because something about you didn't fit what they wanted, they saved you both time.\n\n### Avoidant Behavior\n\nSomeone who unmatches rather than communicating isn't someone you'd have great relationship potential with anyway.\n\n### Different Goals\n\nIf your profiles suggested different things and they realized on closer look, better to unmatch than waste each other's time.\n\n---\n\n## Protecting Your Mental Health\n\n### Don't Check Match Counts Obsessively\n\nKnowing exactly how many matches you have and noticing every unmatch isn't healthy. Check Feeld with intention, not compulsion.\n\n### Keep Multiple Conversations Going\n\nWhen you're invested in one match, an unmatch feels catastrophic. With several conversations active, it's just one of many.\n\n### Remember: Numbers Game\n\nDating apps are volume-based. Not every match works out—that's the design, not a failure.\n\n### Take Breaks When Needed\n\nIf unmatches are affecting your self-worth, take a break from the app. Your mental health matters more than any match.\n\n---\n\n## When to Unmatch Yourself\n\nUnmatching is a reasonable choice when:\n- You realize you're not interested\n- The conversation has clearly died\n- They've said or done something that concerns you\n- You're no longer on the app actively\n- Continuing feels dishonest\n\nYou don't owe anyone an explanation for an unmatch, especially early on.\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Can I see who unmatched me?**\nNo. Feeld doesn't notify you or show who unmatched. They just disappear.\n\n**Does \"not interested\" mean they unmatched?**\nSometimes. Feeld's interface can be confusing. If a match completely disappears, they unmatched or deleted their account.\n\n**How do I know if they deleted the app vs. unmatched me?**\nYou usually can't tell the difference. Either way, the result is the same.\n\n**Should I unmatch or just stop responding?**\nUnmatching is cleaner. Letting conversations sit indefinitely clutters your inbox and leaves things ambiguous.\n\n**Do people get notified when I unmatch?**\nNo. They'll just notice you're gone next time they look for your conversation.\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [Got Ghosted on Feeld?](/feeld-guide/feeld-ghosted-what-to-do)\n- [30 Feeld Conversation Starters](/feeld-guide/feeld-conversation-starters)\n- [Managing Rejection Sensitivity](/dating-confidence/rejection-sensitivity-dating)\n\n---\n\n## Build Connections That Last\n\nUnmatches happen.
