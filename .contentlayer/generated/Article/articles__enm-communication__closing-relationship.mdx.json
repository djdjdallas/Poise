    "raw": "\n\nYou've been practicing ENM, and your partner says they want to close the relationship. Maybe they're struggling with jealousy. Maybe they've realized it's not for them. Maybe circumstances have changed.\n\nThis is one of ENM's most difficult conversations. Here's how to navigate it.\n\n---\n\n## First: Understand What They're Saying\n\n### Listen Before Reacting\n\nDon't respond immediately. Understand first:\n- What specifically are they asking for?\n- Why now?\n- What's driving this?\n- Is this final or exploratory?\n\n### Questions to Ask\n\n> \"Can you tell me more about what's bringing this up?\"\n\n> \"What specifically isn't working for you?\"\n\n> \"Is this something you've been feeling for a while, or is this new?\"\n\n> \"What would closing the relationship solve for you?\"\n\n---\n\n## What Might Be Behind the Request\n\n### Possibility 1: ENM Isn't Right for Them\n\nSome people try ENM and genuinely discover it doesn't fit:\n- The emotional labor is too high\n- Jealousy isn't manageable\n- It conflicts with their values\n- They want partnership structure ENM doesn't offer\n\n**If this is true:** The request is about fundamental compatibility, not a problem to solve.\n\n### Possibility 2: Something Specific Is Wrong\n\nSometimes \"close the relationship\" means something more specific:\n- A particular metamour is the problem\n- Too much time is going to dating\n- They feel neglected\n- A boundary was violated\n\n**If this is true:** The request might actually be about addressing that specific issue.\n\n### Possibility 3: Life Circumstances\n\nExternal factors can make ENM harder:\n- Health issues\n- Work stress\n- Major life changes\n- Parenting demands\n\n**If this is true:** The request might be about capacity, not preference.\n\n### Possibility 4: Fear or Insecurity\n\nSometimes the request comes from:\n- Fear of losing you\n- Insecurity triggered by something specific\n- Comparison to your other relationships\n- Worry about the future\n\n**If this is true:** The underlying emotions might be addressable without closing.\n\n---\n\n## Having the Conversation\n\n### Creating Space\n\n**Set up for success:**\n> \"This is an important conversation. Can we find a time when we're both rested and have privacy to really talk about it?\"\n\n**Approach with openness:**\n> \"I want to understand what you're feeling and figure out what's best for both of us.\"\n\n### Getting to the Root\n\n**Explore what they're actually asking:**\n> \"When you say you want to close the relationship, what does that specifically mean to you?\"\n\n> \"Is there something particular that's happened that's brought this up?\"\n\n> \"What do you imagine would be different if we closed?\"\n\n### Sharing Your Side\n\n**Be honest about your feelings:**\n> \"I hear you, and I want to share how I'm feeling about this too.\"\n\n**Express what ENM means to you:**\n> \"ENM has become an important part of my identity/life/happiness. Closing would be a significant change for me.\"\n\n**Without attacking:**\n> ~~\"You're just jealous and need to work on yourself.\"~~\n> ✓ \"I understand this is hard for you. I want to find something that works for both of us.\"\n\n---\n\n## Possible Responses\n\n### If You're Willing to Close\n\nIf, after consideration, you can accept closing:\n\n> \"I've thought about this, and while I value the ENM parts of our life, I value our relationship more. I'm willing to close if that's what you need.\"\n\n**But be honest with yourself:**\n- Can you genuinely be monogamous?\n- Will you resent this?\n- Is this sustainable long-term?\n\n### If You're Not Willing to Close\n\nIf ENM is too important to give up:\n\n> \"I've thought deeply about this. ENM has become a core part of who I am. I'm not able to commit to long-term monogamy. I know that's hard to hear.\"\n\n**This might mean:**\n- Finding a compromise\n- Accepting incompatibility\n- Ending the relationship\n\n### If You Need Time\n\nIf you don't know yet:\n\n> \"This is a big thing you're asking, and I need time to sit with it. Can we revisit this in a week after I've had time to process?\"\n\n---\n\n## Exploring Middle Ground\n\n### Partial Closing Options\n\nBefore all-or-nothing, consider:\n- Pausing new relationships (keeping existing)\n- Closing temporarily (6 months, reassess)\n- Reducing frequency/intensity\n- Closing to new people, maintaining current connections\n- Different degrees of openness\n\n### Questions to Explore\n\n> \"Is there a version of ENM that might work better for you?\"\n\n> \"What if we took a break from new connections while we worked on us?\"\n\n> \"Could we close temporarily and revisit this in [timeframe]?\"\n\n### Scripts for Middle Ground\n\n**Proposing a pause:**\n> \"What if we stopped pursuing new connections for six months and focused on us? We can reassess then.\"\n\n**Proposing reduced activity:**\n> \"What if I reduced my dating to once a month and we increased our couple time?\"\n\n**Proposing specific changes:**\n> \"It sounds like the issue is [specific thing]. What if we addressed that directly instead of closing entirely?\"\n\n---\n\n## If You Have Other Partners\n\n### The Complication\n\nClosing affects more than just you two:\n- You have relationships with other people\n- They have invested emotionally\n- Ending those relationships has real impact\n\n### Communication with Other Partners\n\n**If closure becomes likely:**\n> \"I need to talk to you about something difficult. My partner is asking to close our relationship. I'm not sure what's going to happen, but I wanted to be honest with you.\"\n\n**If you decide to close:**\n> \"I've made a difficult decision. I need to end outside relationships to work on my primary partnership. I'm so sorry. This isn't about you—it's about what I need to do for that relationship.\"\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n\nClosing doesn't erase obligations:\n- Be honest with other partners ASAP\n- Don't string them along while deciding\n- Give them dignity in the ending\n- Acknowledge their feelings matter too\n\n---\n\n## When You Can't Agree\n\n### The Impasse\n\nIf one person needs monogamy and the other can't do it:\n- This is a fundamental incompatibility\n- Neither person is wrong\n- You may not be able to stay together\n\n### Facing That Reality\n\n**Script:**\n> \"It seems like you need monogamy to be happy, and I need the freedom of ENM to be happy. I don't know how to reconcile that.\"\n\n### What Comes Next\n\nOptions include:\n- Couples therapy to work through\n- Trial periods to test different arrangements\n- Accepting incompatibility and separating\n- One person compromising (unsustainable?)\n\n---\n\n## After the Decision\n\n### If You Close\n\n- End outside relationships ethically\n- Allow grief for what you're losing\n- Invest in the relationship you're prioritizing\n- Don't hold resentment\n- Revisit if circumstances change\n\n### If You Stay Open\n\n- Address their underlying concerns\n- Increase support and reassurance\n- Make changes to what isn't working\n- Monitor how they're doing\n- Don't dismiss their struggles\n\n### If You Separate\n\n- Acknowledge the loss\n- Allow yourself to grieve\n- Learn from the relationship\n- Neither person is the villain\n\n---\n\n## Getting Support\n\n### For the Conversation\n\n- ENM-friendly couples therapist\n- Trusted friends (not in the polycule)\n- Online communities for perspective\n\n### For the Transition\n\nWhatever you decide, support helps:\n- Individual therapy\n- Community support\n- Time and patience with yourselves\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [Opening Up Without Blowing Up](/enm-communication/opening-up-guide)\n- [Renegotiating Relationship Agreements](/enm-communication/renegotiation-scripts)\n- [When One Partner Gets More Matches](/enm-communication/match-disparity-guide)\n- [Handling NRE Without Neglecting Partners](/enm-communication/nre-management-guide)\n\n---\n\n## Navigate Difficult Decisions Together\n\nThis conversation requires exceptional care.
