You're not alone. The ping is one of Feeld's most distinctive features, but it's also one of the most misunderstood.\n\nUnderstanding the ping can genuinely change your Feeld experience. Used well, it's a subtle, low-pressure way to signal interest. Used poorly, it becomes noise that people ignore. This guide breaks down everything you need to know about pings—what they are, when to use them, and how to make them work for you.\n\n---\n\n## What Is a Ping on Feeld?\n\nA ping is Feeld's version of a \"super like\" or \"nudge\"—but with important differences from what you might find on other apps.\n\nWhen you ping someone, you're sending them a notification that says, essentially, \"I noticed you, and I want you to notice me back.\" Unlike a regular like, which the other person might never see unless they also like you, a ping goes directly to their inbox.\n\nThink of it like this: if a like is making eye contact across a crowded room, a ping is walking over and tapping someone on the shoulder. It's more forward, more intentional, and more visible.\n\n### How Pings Work Technically\n\n- You get a limited number of pings (exact number depends on your membership tier)\n- Majestic (premium) members get more pings than free users\n- Pings refresh periodically\n- When someone receives your ping, they see it in their connections/notifications\n- They can then view your profile and decide whether to connect\n\n### What the Other Person Sees\n\nWhen you ping someone, they receive a notification and can see:\n- Your profile photos\n- Your basic information\n- That you specifically pinged them (not just a passive like)\n\nThis visibility is both the power and the risk of the ping. You're putting yourself out there in a way that's harder to ignore.\n\n---\n\n## Ping vs. Like vs. Message: What's the Difference?\n\nUnderstanding the hierarchy of Feeld interactions helps you choose the right approach.\n\n### The Like\n\nA like on Feeld is the most passive form of interest. When you like someone's profile:\n- They only find out if they also like you (creating a match)\n- If they don't like you back, they never know you existed\n- It's low-risk but also potentially low-reward\n- You can like many profiles without much thought\n\n**Best for:** Casual browsing, profiles you find moderately interesting, when you're not sure about compatibility.\n\n### The Ping\n\nA ping is a step up from a like. When you ping someone:\n- They see your interest regardless of whether they've liked you\n- It signals that you're specifically interested in them\n- It's more personal and intentional than a like\n- You have limited pings, so each one should count\n\n**Best for:** Profiles that genuinely excite you, people you think are a great match, when you want to stand out.\n\n### The Message\n\nIf you're both connected (either through mutual likes or after a ping is accepted), you can message. Some situations also allow direct messaging:\n- Majestic members can sometimes message without matching first\n- Certain connection settings allow open messaging\n\n**Best for:** Actually starting a conversation, but only possible after a connection is made.\n\n### Quick Comparison Table\n\n| Feature | Visibility | Effort Required | Best Use Case |\n|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Like | Only if mutual | Low | General interest |\n| Ping | Immediate | Medium | Strong interest |\n| Message | Direct | High | Starting conversation |\n\n---\n\n## When to Use a Ping\n\nNot every profile deserves a ping. Since you have limited pings, you want to use them strategically. Here's when pinging makes sense:\n\n### 1. When You're Genuinely Excited\n\nIf you're scrolling and someone's profile makes you stop—actually stop and read everything—that's ping-worthy. The profile that makes you think, \"I really want to talk to this person,\" not just \"they're attractive enough.\"\n\nSigns of a ping-worthy profile:\n- You have specific things you want to ask or talk about\n- Their desires/interests align strongly with yours\n- Something in their bio genuinely resonated with you\n- You could write them a real message right now\n\n### 2. When a Like Might Get Lost\n\nSome users have extremely busy profiles. Couples, unicorns, and people with particularly striking photos get hundreds of likes. Your like might never surface in their queue.\n\nA ping cuts through that noise. It says, \"I'm not just passively swiping—I specifically chose you.\"\n\n### 3. When There's Clear Compatibility\n\nIf someone's profile suggests you'd be a great match—similar relationship style, aligned desires, compatible interests—a ping signals that you've actually read their profile and see the connection.\n\n### 4. When You Want to Be Memorable\n\nSometimes you come across a profile and think, \"This person is going to have options. I need to stand out.\" A ping is your way of differentiating yourself from the crowd of likes.\n\n---\n\n## When NOT to Use a Ping\n\nJust as important as knowing when to ping is knowing when to hold back.\n\n### 1. When You're Just Mildly Curious\n\nPings are precious. Don't waste them on \"eh, might as well\" profiles. If you're not excited enough to message them if they respond, don't ping.\n\n### 2. When You Haven't Read Their Profile\n\nPinging someone without reading their profile is obvious—and it shows when your opening message is generic. If you ping and then send \"hey,\" you've wasted the ping's potential.\n\n### 3. When Your Profile Isn't Ready\n\nBefore you start pinging, make sure your own profile is solid. When someone receives your ping, they're going to check you out. If your photos are blurry or your bio is empty, you've just highlighted yourself as unprepared.\n\n### 4. When You're Spray-and-Praying\n\nSome people try to ping everyone, treating it like a numbers game. This approach is ineffective and draining. Each ping should be intentional.\n\n### 5. When Their Profile Says No Pings\n\nSome users specifically mention in their bio that they prefer messages to pings, or that they find pings impersonal. Respect that. It shows you actually read their profile.\n\n---\n\n## Ping Etiquette: The Unwritten Rules\n\nFeeld has its own culture, and pinging comes with unwritten expectations. Here's how to ping like someone who gets it:\n\n### Do: Follow Up with a Real Message\n\nIf your ping leads to a connection, don't just wait. Send a message that references something specific from their profile. The ping got their attention; now reward that attention.\n\n**Good follow-up:**\n> \"I pinged because I loved what you wrote about spontaneous adventure—I'm also someone who books a trip the day before. What's the last random thing you did?\"\n\n**Bad follow-up:**\n> \"Hey there\"\n\n### Do: Accept That Pings Don't Guarantee Responses\n\nJust because you pinged doesn't mean they owe you anything. People are busy. They might have a full connections queue. They might have liked you back but not messaged yet.\n\nPatience is part of the ping.\n\n### Don't: Ping Again If They Didn't Respond\n\nIf someone didn't respond to your ping, sending another one comes across as pushy or unaware. Take the hint gracefully. There are plenty of people on Feeld who would be excited to hear from you.\n\n### Don't: Use Pings as Pressure\n\nA ping is an invitation, not a demand. Don't send a ping and then get frustrated that someone didn't respond immediately. That energy will come through in any follow-up messages.\n\n### Do: Receive Pings Graciously\n\nIf someone pings you and you're not interested, you can simply not respond—that's normal. But if you do respond, even a polite \"thanks but I don't think we're a match\" is kind. They put themselves out there.\n\n### Don't: Ping Couples Without Being Ready for Both\n\nIf you ping a couple's profile, understand that you're signaling interest in connecting with both people. If you're only interested in one half of the couple, that's a different conversation—and probably not one to start with a ping.\n\n---\n\n## Making the Most of Your Pings\n\nHere's how to maximize the effectiveness of each ping you send:\n\n### 1. Optimize Your Profile First\n\nBefore you start pinging, make sure your profile is as strong as possible. This includes:\n- Clear, recent photos that show your face\n- A bio that reflects your personality and what you're looking for\n- Accurate desires and interests\n- Photos that represent your actual life\n\nThe ping draws attention to you. Make sure there's something worth seeing when they look.\n\n### 2. Be Strategic About Timing\n\nPings sent during active hours are more likely to be seen and acted on. While there's no perfect time, consider:\n- Evening hours when people are browsing\n- Weekends when people have more time to respond\n- Avoiding late-night pings that might feel thirsty\n\n### 3. Have Your Opening Message Ready\n\nWhen someone responds to your ping, be ready to start a real conversation. Don't wait three days to message. Strike while the interest is mutual.\n\n### 4. Keep Notes on Who You've Pinged\n\nIt's easy to lose track, especially if you're using Feeld actively. Keep a mental (or actual) note of who you've pinged, so you remember the context when they respond.\n\n### 5. Use Pings and Likes Together\n\nYour strategy doesn't have to be all pings or all likes. Use likes liberally for people you find interesting, and save pings for the ones who genuinely excite you. This way, you're covering more ground while still using pings strategically.\n\n---\n\n## What to Do When Someone Pings You\n\nReceiving a ping feels good—someone specifically chose to highlight their interest in you. Here's how to handle incoming pings:\n\n### 1. Check Their Profile Thoughtfully\n\nThey took the time to ping you. Take the time to actually read their profile rather than just glancing at photos.\n\n### 2. Respond If You're Interested\n\nIf their profile appeals to you, connect back and send a message. Don't just connect and wait—they made the first move, but a connection requires mutual effort.\n\n### 3. It's Okay to Not Respond\n\nNot every ping will be from someone compatible. You don't owe anyone a response. Simply not connecting is a clear enough signal.\n\n### 4. Don't Feel Obligated\n\nA ping doesn't mean you have to match with someone if you're not interested. It's flattering, but you're still allowed to have standards and preferences.\n\n---\n\n## Pings and Premium (Majestic) Membership\n\nFeeld's premium tier, called Majestic, affects your ping experience in several ways:\n\n### More Pings\n\nMajestic members receive additional pings, which means more opportunities to signal strong interest. If you find yourself running out of pings regularly, this might be worth considering.\n\n### Better Visibility\n\nPremium features can help your profile get seen more, which means your pings might be coming from a more engaged, visible profile.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nPremium features like seeing who liked you can help you decide when a ping might be more effective—like pinging someone who already liked you to escalate the connection.\n\n---\n\n## Common Ping Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)\n\n### Mistake 1: The Drive-By Ping\n\n**What it looks like:** Pinging someone without ever messaging them, even after they connect.\n\n**Why it fails:** The ping got their attention, but then you did nothing with it. It seems low-effort or even accidental.\n\n**Fix:** Always be ready to follow up a ping with a genuine message.\n\n### Mistake 2: The Generic Opener Post-Ping\n\n**What it looks like:** Ping → connection → \"hey how are you\"\n\n**Why it fails:** You went out of your way to ping, suggesting strong interest, then sent the most generic possible message. It's confusing.\n\n**Fix:** Reference their profile. Mention why you pinged. Make the effort match the signal.\n\n### Mistake 3: Over-Explaining the Ping\n\n**What it looks like:** \"I know I pinged you and I hope that's not weird, I just thought your profile was really interesting and I wanted to make sure you saw me...\"\n\n**Why it fails:** It's insecure. The ping is the move. Own it.\n\n**Fix:** Be confident. A simple \"Your profile stood out—[specific thing]\" works better.\n\n### Mistake 4: Pinging During a Profile Rebuild\n\n**What it looks like:** Pinging with incomplete photos, empty bio, or generic content.\n\n**Why it fails:** You're drawing attention to an unfinished profile.\n\n**Fix:** Get your profile right first, then start pinging.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts: The Philosophy of the Ping\n\nThe ping is a uniquely Feeld feature because it matches Feeld's ethos: intentional, confident, and direct. Unlike apps where you swipe endlessly and hope for the best, Feeld rewards you for knowing what you want and going after it.\n\nUse your pings on people who genuinely interest you. Follow up with real conversation. Accept that not everyone will respond—and that's okay. The ping isn't about casting a wide net; it's about saying, \"You, specifically, caught my attention.\"\n\nWhen used with intention and followed by genuine engagement, pings become your secret weapon for making meaningful connections on Feeld.\n\n---\n\n## Struggling with What to Say After a Ping?\n\nThe ping got their attention.
