    "raw": "\nYou're in a relationship, but you don't exist—at least not publicly. Their friends don't know about you. Their family has no idea. You're hidden, compartmentalized, invisible.\n\nFeeling like a dirty secret is painful. Here's how to navigate it.\n\n---\n\n## What \"Dirty Secret\" Feels Like\n\n### The Experience\n\n**You might feel:**\n- Invisible to their broader life\n- Like you don't matter enough to acknowledge\n- Hidden away like something shameful\n- Compartmentalized instead of integrated\n\n### Common Scenarios\n\n**How it shows up:**\n- You've never met their friends\n- Their family doesn't know you exist\n- They don't post about you on social media\n- You're never introduced to anyone in their life\n- They change the subject when your relationship comes up\n- You're referred to as \"a friend\" if mentioned at all\n\n### The Pain\n\n**Why it hurts:**\n- Feels like they're ashamed of you\n- Suggests you're not important enough\n- Creates insecurity about the relationship\n- Makes you feel like less than a \"real\" partner\n\n---\n\n## Legitimate Reasons for Privacy\n\n### Not Everyone Can Be Out\n\n**Real constraints:**\n- Job security (some workplaces aren't safe)\n- Family relationships (risk of being cut off)\n- Custody concerns (courts can be biased)\n- Community position (some communities are hostile)\n- Safety (real risk of harassment or harm)\n\nBeing closeted about ENM isn't always about shame—sometimes it's about survival.\n\n### Gradual Integration Is Normal\n\n**Healthy pacing:**\n- New relationships don't get introduced to everyone immediately\n- Integration happens over time as relationships develop\n- Early-stage privacy is different from permanent hiding\n- Some compartmentalization is normal and healthy\n\n### Partner's Autonomy\n\n**Their right to decide:**\n- How out they are\n- Who knows about their relationship structure\n- When and how to share\n- How to manage different spheres of life\n\n---\n\n## When It's a Problem\n\n### Signs This Isn't Just Privacy\n\n**Red flags:**\n- You've been together a long time and no one knows\n- They're out as poly with other partners but not you\n- They've made promises to introduce you that never materialize\n- Their secrecy feels selective (hiding you specifically)\n- You feel like they're protecting a \"primary\" relationship by hiding you\n\n### The \"Hierarchy of Visibility\"\n\n**Concerning patterns:**\n- Their other partners are integrated; you're not\n- Some relationships are acknowledged; yours isn't\n- You're treated as \"less than\" in terms of acknowledgment\n- There's a clear hierarchy where you're at the bottom\n\n### Indefinite Hiddenness\n\n**When \"for now\" becomes forever:**\n- No timeline for change\n- Excuses that keep extending\n- Promises without action\n- Years pass without progress\n\n---\n\n## Questions to Ask Yourself\n\n### Is This Temporary?\n\n**Consider:**\n- How long have you been together?\n- Is there a reasonable timeline for change?\n- Are circumstances actually preventing acknowledgment?\n- Is there movement toward integration?\n\n### What Do You Need?\n\n**Get clear on:**\n- What acknowledgment would look like for you\n- What's the minimum you need to feel valued\n- Whether you can accept their level of visibility long-term\n- What integration matters most to you\n\n### Is This About Them or About You?\n\n**Examine:**\n- Are they treating all partners this way, or just you?\n- Is their privacy consistent across relationships?\n- Are there signs they're specifically ashamed of you?\n- Could your expectations be unrealistic for the stage you're at?\n\n---\n\n## How to Address It\n\n### Start With Curiosity\n\n**Opening the conversation:**\n> \"I'd like to understand better how you think about privacy around our relationship. Can we talk about what's behind your approach?\"\n\nThis invites explanation without accusation.\n\n### Share Your Experience\n\n**Express impact:**\n> \"When I'm not acknowledged to the people in your life, I feel [invisible/unimportant/like a dirty secret]. I want to understand your perspective and share how it affects me.\"\n\n### Ask About Timeline\n\n**Get specifics:**\n> \"I understand you have reasons for privacy right now. What would need to change for me to be more integrated into your life? Is there a timeline?\"\n\n### State Your Needs\n\n**Be clear:**\n> \"I need to feel like a real part of your life, not someone hidden away. What does that look like for us?\"\n\n---\n\n## Possible Outcomes\n\n### They Have Valid Reasons\n\n**If privacy is necessary:**\n- They explain the constraints clearly\n- There's a path forward (even if slow)\n- They acknowledge your pain and work to mitigate it\n- You feel understood and valued despite the limitation\n\n**Your choice:** Can you accept this constraint? For how long?\n\n### They're Willing to Change\n\n**If they hear you:**\n- They recognize the impact\n- They commit to specific steps\n- Change actually happens\n- Integration begins\n\n**Your choice:** Give it time; see if actions match words.\n\n### They're Unwilling to Change\n\n**If they dismiss or deflect:**\n- Your needs are minimized\n- No path forward is offered\n- They expect you to accept permanent hiddenness\n- The relationship's limitations become clear\n\n**Your choice:** Accept or leave.\n\n### They're Specifically Hiding You\n\n**If it's about you, not ENM:**\n- Other partners are acknowledged; you're not\n- Reasons don't hold up under examination\n- The pattern suggests you're not valued equally\n- It's not about closeting; it's about you specifically\n\n**Your choice:** This is a serious problem. Consider whether this relationship serves you.\n\n---\n\n## Navigating Legitimate Privacy\n\n### If They Can't Be Out\n\n**Ways to feel valued anyway:**\n- Private acknowledgments (cards, gifts, words)\n- Quality time that feels intentional\n- Integration where possible (poly friends, ENM community)\n- Clear communication about constraints and feelings\n\n### Creating Your Own Integration\n\n**Build your own:**\n- Friendships who know about the relationship\n- Community where you're acknowledged\n- Support system that validates your experience\n- Life where you're not dependent on their acknowledgment\n\n### Agreements That Help\n\n**Negotiate:**\n- What can they acknowledge, to whom?\n- What symbols of commitment are private but meaningful?\n- When will circumstances change (if ever)?\n- What will you do if nothing changes?\n\n---\n\n## When to Walk Away\n\n### This Isn't Sustainable If...\n\n**Consider leaving if:**\n- You've communicated clearly and nothing changes\n- The secrecy is damaging your self-esteem\n- They're out with others but not with you\n- There's no timeline and no willingness to discuss one\n- You fundamentally need acknowledgment they can't provide\n\n### The Conversation\n\n**If you're ending it:**\n> \"I care about you, but I need to be in a relationship where I'm acknowledged. This level of secrecy isn't working for me, and I don't see a path to change. I think we need to end this.\"\n\n### Honoring Your Needs\n\nIt's okay to need acknowledgment. It's okay to leave a relationship that doesn't provide it. Your needs matter.\n\n---\n\n## For the Partner Doing the Hiding\n\n### If Someone Feels Hidden\n\n**Check yourself:**\n- Are my reasons for privacy legitimate and current?\n- Am I treating this partner differently than others?\n- Have I explained my constraints clearly?\n- Am I working toward change where possible?\n\n### What You Can Offer\n\n**Even with constraints:**\n- Clear communication about why\n- Timeline for any potential changes\n- Acknowledgment in spheres where it's safe\n- Validation of their feelings about being hidden\n\n### The Hard Truth\n\nIf you can't or won't acknowledge someone as your partner, be honest about that. They deserve to make an informed choice about whether to stay.\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**How long is reasonable to be hidden?**\nDepends on circumstances. Early in a relationship, some privacy is normal. Long-term with no path to change is concerning. Years of being hidden is usually a problem.\n\n**What if they're only out to some people?**\nPartial visibility is common and can be fine. The question is whether you're included in the \"out\" sphere at all, and whether the hiddenness feels targeted at you.\n\n**Is it okay to give an ultimatum?**\nYou can state your needs clearly: \"I need to be acknowledged to feel valued in this relationship. If that can't happen, I need to reconsider whether this works for me.\" That's a boundary, not a manipulation.\n\n**What if I'm the \"secondary\" and that's why I'm hidden?**\nEven secondary partners can be acknowledged. If their hierarchy means you're permanently invisible, that's a choice they're making—and one you can decide not to accept.\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [Feeling Replaced by Your Partner's New Person](/enm-communication/feeling-replaced-poly)\n- [How to Ask for What You Need in ENM](/enm-communication/asking-for-needs-enm)\n- [Introducing Your Partners to Friends and Family](/enm-communication/introducing-partners-friends)\n\n---\n\n## You Deserve to Be Seen\n\nBeing in a relationship shouldn't mean being invisible.
