    "raw": "\n\nRelationship anarchy (RA) is often misunderstood as \"polyamory without rules\" or \"doing whatever you want.\" It's actually a thoughtful philosophy about how we relate to all people in our lives.\n\nHere's what relationship anarchy actually means and how it works in practice.\n\n---\n\n## What Is Relationship Anarchy?\n\n### The Core Philosophy\n\nRelationship anarchy, as articulated by Andie Nordgren, includes these principles:\n\n**No default hierarchies:**\nRomantic relationships aren't automatically more important than friendships or other connections.\n\n**Each relationship is autonomous:**\nEvery connection is defined by the people in it, not by external scripts.\n\n**Love is abundant:**\nCaring for one person doesn't diminish capacity to care for others.\n\n**No ownership:**\nPeople aren't possessions. Partners don't own each other's bodies, time, or choices.\n\n### What RA Questions\n\nTraditional assumptions like:\n- Romantic partner > friends\n- Sexual relationships are \"more\"\n- Commitments require exclusivity\n- Love should look a certain way\n- Relationship structures should follow society's scripts\n\n---\n\n## RA vs. Polyamory\n\n### They Overlap But Aren't the Same\n\n**Polyamory:**\n- Multiple romantic/sexual relationships\n- Often still has hierarchy (primary/secondary)\n- May follow relationship escalator with multiple people\n- Romantic relationships still central\n\n**Relationship Anarchy:**\n- Questions the romantic/non-romantic hierarchy itself\n- May or may not include multiple romantic relationships\n- Rejects escalator thinking entirely\n- All relationships evaluated on their own terms\n\n### You Can Be Both\n\nMany people identify as poly AND relationship anarchist. Others are RA but only have one romantic relationship. The philosophy is about how you approach relationships, not how many you have.\n\n---\n\n## RA Principles in Practice\n\n### Principle 1: No Default Hierarchies\n\n**Traditional script:**\nPartner > Best friend > Friends > Family (or some variation where romantic partner sits at top)\n\n**RA approach:**\nEach relationship's importance is based on the connection itself, not its category.\n\n**Example:**\nAn RA person might prioritize their best friend for a life decision over a romantic partner of six months—because that particular friendship holds more relevant significance in that context.\n\n### Principle 2: Custom-Built Relationships\n\n**Traditional script:**\nDating → Exclusive → Cohabitation → Marriage → Kids (the relationship escalator)\n\n**RA approach:**\nEach relationship is built based on what the people in it want, not what society expects.\n\n**Example:**\nTwo people might have a deeply committed relationship without sexual activity, without living together, and without using terms like \"partner\"—because that's what works for them.\n\n### Principle 3: Relationships Are Not Contracts\n\n**Traditional script:**\n\"Boyfriend/girlfriend\" comes with assumed rights and obligations.\n\n**RA approach:**\nEvery expectation is explicitly discussed rather than assumed from a label.\n\n**Example:**\nAn RA person wouldn't assume their romantic partner should be their plus-one to every event—that's something they'd discuss rather than assume.\n\n### Principle 4: Love Doesn't Require Restrictions\n\n**Traditional script:**\nIf you love me, you won't want anyone else.\n\n**RA approach:**\nLove in one relationship doesn't threaten others. Restriction isn't proof of love.\n\n**Example:**\nAn RA person might feel compersion (joy) when their partner develops a new meaningful connection—because that connection doesn't diminish their own.\n\n---\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n\n### \"RA means no rules\"\n\n**Reality:** RA means no *assumed* rules. Agreements still exist—they're just explicit and negotiated, not inherited from relationship labels.\n\n### \"RA means no commitment\"\n\n**Reality:** RA people can be deeply committed. They just define commitment through their own agreements, not society's templates.\n\n### \"RA means romantic relationships don't matter\"\n\n**Reality:** RA means romantic relationships aren't *automatically* more important. They can still be deeply significant—just not by default.\n\n### \"RA is just an excuse to avoid responsibility\"\n\n**Reality:** RA actually requires more responsibility—you can't hide behind assumptions. Every expectation must be communicated.\n\n---\n\n## Real-World RA Examples\n\n### Example 1: Prioritizing Friendship\n\n**Scenario:** Jamie has a romantic partner of two years and a best friend of ten years. Jamie's friend is going through a crisis.\n\n**Traditional approach:** Romance comes first; spend time with friend when partner doesn't need you.\n\n**RA approach:** The depth of each relationship matters, not its category. Jamie might spend significant time supporting their friend without feeling like they're \"shortchanging\" their romantic partner.\n\n### Example 2: Non-Sexual Partnership\n\n**Scenario:** Alex and Sam live together, share finances, consider themselves life partners, but don't have sex and don't use romantic labels.\n\n**Traditional approach:** This \"doesn't count\" as a real partnership—it's just roommates.\n\n**RA approach:** Alex and Sam's relationship is whatever they define it as. The absence of sex or romance doesn't make it less significant.\n\n### Example 3: Relationship Without Escalation\n\n**Scenario:** Morgan and Chris have dated for five years. They don't live together and have no plans to. Both are satisfied.\n\n**Traditional approach:** \"When are you taking the next step?\"\n\n**RA approach:** There's no required escalator. Their relationship is complete as-is if it works for them.\n\n### Example 4: Multiple Significant Relationships\n\n**Scenario:** Taylor has a romantic partner, a queer platonic partner, a friends-with-benefits situation, and a deeply intimate friendship. Taylor considers all four equally significant in different ways.\n\n**Traditional approach:** The romantic partner is \"the\" relationship; others are supplementary.\n\n**RA approach:** Each relationship stands on its own terms. Comparing them by category misses the point.\n\n---\n\n## Is RA Right for You?\n\n### RA Might Resonate If:\n\n- Romantic hierarchy has felt wrong to you\n- You value deep friendships as much as romance\n- You resist relationship scripts\n- You want to define connections on your own terms\n- Autonomy is a core value\n\n### RA Might Not Fit If:\n\n- You find comfort in traditional structures\n- Romantic partnership *is* what you want to prioritize\n- The philosophy feels overly complicated\n- You prefer clearer categories\n- Nothing here resonates\n\n### It's Not All or Nothing\n\nYou can be influenced by RA principles without adopting the full philosophy:\n- Valuing friendships more highly\n- Questioning assumed hierarchies\n- Building custom agreements\n- Rejecting one-size-fits-all templates\n\n---\n\n## Communicating RA\n\n### On Dating Apps\n\n> \"I practice relationship anarchy—I don't assume romantic relationships are automatically more important than other connections. Every relationship is built on what works for the people in it.\"\n\n### With New Connections\n\n> \"I approach relationships anarchistically, which means I don't follow scripts or assume what our connection should look like. I'd rather build something that fits us than fit us into a template.\"\n\n### Addressing Concerns\n\n> \"Relationship anarchy doesn't mean no commitment or no care—it means I want to be intentional about what we create together rather than inheriting assumptions.\"\n\n---\n\n## Challenges of RA\n\n### Social Recognition\n\n- People may not understand your relationships\n- Your \"best friend\" may be as significant as others' \"spouses\"\n- Labels don't capture the nuance\n\n### Communication Load\n\n- More explicit discussion required\n- Can't rely on assumed expectations\n- Every relationship needs its own negotiation\n\n### Finding Compatible People\n\n- Not everyone wants to build from scratch\n- Some people prefer traditional structures\n- Explaining RA repeatedly can be exhausting\n\n---\n\n## Resources for Further Exploration\n\n### Foundational Texts\n\n- \"The short instructional manifesto for relationship anarchy\" by Andie Nordgren\n\n### Key Concepts to Explore\n\n- Relationship escalator\n- Amatonormativity\n- Compulsory monogamy\n- Queer platonic relationships\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [Am I Actually Polyamorous?](/enm-communication/am-i-poly-guide)\n- [Solo Poly vs Single](/enm-communication/solo-poly-vs-single)\n- [The Relationship Smorgasbord](/enm-communication/relationship-smorgasbord)\n- [How to Label Your Relationship Style](/enm-communication/relationship-style-labels)\n\n---\n\n## Communicate Your Philosophy\n\nWhatever relationship philosophy you hold, clear communication makes it work.
