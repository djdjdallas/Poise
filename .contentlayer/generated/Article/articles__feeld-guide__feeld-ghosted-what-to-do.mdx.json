    "raw": "\nYou were having a great conversation. Maybe you'd even made plans. Then suddenly—nothing. No response, no explanation, just silence.\n\nWelcome to getting ghosted on Feeld. It happens to everyone, and it never feels great.\n\nHere's how to handle it.\n\n---\n\n## Why People Ghost on Feeld\n\nUnderstanding the \"why\" doesn't fix the sting, but it helps you not take it personally.\n\n### They Got Overwhelmed\n\nFeeld users—especially women and attractive profiles—get a lot of messages. Sometimes people simply can't keep up and let conversations slip.\n\n**This isn't about you**: It's about bandwidth.\n\n### Life Happened\n\nPeople get busy, stressed, distracted. They meant to respond and then... didn't. Days passed. Now it feels weird to reply.\n\n**This isn't about you**: It's about their life.\n\n### They Met Someone\n\nFeeld users often date multiple people. Sometimes someone else becomes the focus and other conversations fade.\n\n**This isn't about you**: It's about timing.\n\n### Their Partner Had Concerns\n\nFor coupled users, a partner's discomfort can suddenly shut things down without explanation.\n\n**This isn't about you**: It's about their relationship dynamics.\n\n### They Lost Interest\n\nSometimes the connection that seemed good wasn't as strong for them. Rather than have an awkward conversation, they disappeared.\n\n**This might be about fit**: But not your worth.\n\n### They Were Never Serious\n\nSome people use dating apps for validation, boredom, or entertainment without intending to actually meet anyone.\n\n**This isn't about you**: It's about them.\n\n---\n\n## The Stages of Getting Ghosted\n\n### 1. Confusion\n\"Did I say something wrong? Maybe they're just busy?\"\n\n### 2. Hope\n\"They'll probably respond later. People get busy.\"\n\n### 3. Checking\nOpening the app repeatedly. Looking at their activity. Analyzing your last message.\n\n### 4. Disappointment\nRealizing they're probably not going to respond.\n\n### 5. Moving On\nAccepting it and refocusing your energy.\n\nThe goal is to move through these stages quickly rather than getting stuck in stages 2-4.\n\n---\n\n## What To Do When You Get Ghosted\n\n### Wait (Briefly)\n\nGive it 48-72 hours before concluding you've been ghosted. People do get busy. Life does interfere.\n\n### Send One Follow-Up (Optional)\n\nA single, low-key follow-up is acceptable:\n\n> \"Hey! Hope your week's going well. Did life get crazy, or should I take the hint? Either way, no hard feelings.\"\n\n> \"Hey, just checking in—hope everything's okay on your end.\"\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Send multiple messages\n- Demand an explanation\n- Express frustration or hurt\n- Try to guilt them into responding\n\nIf they don't respond to one follow-up, that's your answer.\n\n### Accept the Non-Response as a Response\n\nSilence is communication. It says: \"I'm not interested enough to continue this.\"\n\nIt's not the communication you deserved, but it's the one you got. Accept it and move forward.\n\n### Delete and Move On\n\nOnce you've accepted it:\n- Unmatch or hide the conversation\n- Stop checking their profile\n- Redirect your energy elsewhere\n\nKeeping the conversation visible keeps the hope alive unnecessarily.\n\n---\n\n## What NOT to Do\n\n### Don't Take It Personally\n\nGhosting says very little about you and a lot about them. People ghost when they:\n- Don't know how to communicate\n- Avoid discomfort\n- Have their own issues\n\nYour worth isn't determined by whether a stranger responded to messages.\n\n### Don't Send Angry Messages\n\nTempting? Yes. Satisfying? Momentarily. Worth it? Never.\n\n**Don't send:**\n> \"Wow, thanks for wasting my time.\"\n> \"You could at least have the decency to respond.\"\n> \"I guess I dodged a bullet.\"\n\nEven if you're hurt, aggressive follow-ups make you look bad and don't accomplish anything.\n\n### Don't Stalk Their Activity\n\nChecking when they were last active, whether they updated their profile, or if they're still on the app will only make you feel worse.\n\n### Don't Make It Mean Something About You\n\nOne person not responding doesn't mean:\n- You're undesirable\n- Your profile is bad\n- No one will ever be interested\n- There's something wrong with you\n\nIt means one person, for their own reasons, stopped responding. That's it.\n\n---\n\n## When Ghosting Hurts More\n\n### After Plans Were Made\n\nGetting ghosted after you've made plans to meet is particularly frustrating. You set aside time, maybe felt excited, and then... nothing.\n\n**What to do:**\n- Send one confirmation message the day before\n- If no response, don't show up\n- Process the disappointment\n- Move on\n\n### After Meeting\n\nGetting ghosted after a date is harder because it feels more personal. You met, you thought it went well, and then silence.\n\n**What to do:**\n- Send one follow-up: \"I had a good time yesterday. Would love to see you again if you're interested.\"\n- If no response after a few days, accept it\n- Remember: Their silence reflects their communication skills, not your worth\n\n### After Intimacy\n\nGetting ghosted after a sexual encounter is the most painful form. It can feel like you were used.\n\n**What to do:**\n- Allow yourself to feel hurt (it's valid)\n- Recognize this says everything about them and nothing about you\n- Talk to supportive friends if needed\n- Be more cautious about intimacy before trust is established in the future\n\n---\n\n## Preventing Future Ghosting\n\nYou can't control others' behavior, but you can reduce ghosting likelihood:\n\n### Vet Before Investing\n\nLook for signs of genuine interest:\n- They ask questions about you\n- They share things about themselves\n- They respond with substance, not just emojis\n- They seem invested in the conversation\n\n### Don't Over-Invest Early\n\nIf you're deeply emotionally invested after 10 messages with a stranger, you'll feel worse when it doesn't work out.\n\nKeep perspective: You don't really know someone until you've spent significant time together.\n\n### Move to Meeting Sooner\n\nEndless messaging often leads to ghosting. The longer conversations go without meeting, the more likely they'll fizzle.\n\nSuggest meeting after reasonable rapport is established.\n\n### Watch for Patterns\n\nIf someone takes days to respond, gives minimal effort, or seems distracted, they may be on the way out. Don't be surprised if that leads to ghosting.\n\n---\n\n## Should You Ever Ghost?\n\nControversial take: Sometimes ghosting is appropriate.\n\n**Acceptable to ghost:**\n- After just a few messages exchanged\n- When someone's being inappropriate\n- When you feel unsafe\n- When you've already clearly communicated disinterest and they persist\n\n**Not acceptable to ghost:**\n- After making plans to meet\n- After meeting in person\n- After intimacy\n- After significant conversations\n\nIn most cases, a brief \"I don't think we're a match, but good luck!\" takes 10 seconds and treats the other person with basic respect.\n\n---\n\n## Reframing Ghosting\n\n### It's a Filter\n\nGhosting shows you who someone is before you've invested much. Someone who ghosts would probably also:\n- Avoid difficult conversations\n- Struggle with emotional communication\n- Cause bigger hurt later\n\nBetter to find out now.\n\n### It's Common\n\nYou're not uniquely being ghosted. Studies suggest 20-30% of dating app conversations end in ghosting. It's practically standard.\n\n### It's Not Personal\n\nWhen someone ghosts, they're dealing with their own stuff—overwhelm, avoidance, life circumstances, other connections. It rarely has anything to do with you specifically.\n\n### It Gets Easier\n\nThe more you date, the less each individual ghosting affects you. It stops feeling like rejection and starts feeling like just... noise.\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**How long before it's officially ghosting?**\nIf someone regularly responded within hours and now hasn't responded in 3-4 days, you've probably been ghosted. But people's lives vary—some take longer naturally.\n\n**Should I ever reach out again later?**\nAfter months? Sometimes people come back. You can respond if you want, but go in without expectations. Patterns usually repeat.\n\n**What if they come back?**\nUp to you. If they apologize and explain, you might give them another chance. If they act like nothing happened, proceed with caution.\n\n**How do I stop checking the app compulsively?**\nTurn off notifications. Delete the app temporarily. Fill your time with other activities. Give yourself a set time to check once daily.\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [Why People Unmatch on Feeld](/feeld-guide/feeld-unmatch-reasons)\n- [How to Keep a Feeld Conversation Going](/feeld-guide/feeld-keep-conversation-going)\n- [Managing Rejection Sensitivity](/dating-confidence/rejection-sensitivity-dating)\n\n---\n\n## Move Forward With Confidence\n\nGhosting stings, but it doesn't have to derail your dating life.
