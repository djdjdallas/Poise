    "raw": "\n\nMost people swipe through dating profiles like they're scrolling Instagram—a quick glance at photos, maybe a skim of the bio, left or right, next.\n\nThis is a mistake.\n\nA profile is rich with information if you know how to read it. It can tell you about compatibility, communication style, what someone values, what they're looking for, and whether a conversation is likely to go anywhere.\n\nLearning to read profiles well doesn't just help you match with better-fit people. It also gives you material for actually talking to them. When you message someone based on something you genuinely noticed in their profile, you're starting from a much better place than the people sending \"hey.\"\n\nLet's develop this skill.\n\n---\n\n## The Art of Profile Reading\n\nReading a profile isn't like reading a resume, where you're just gathering facts. It's more like reading a short story—you're looking for voice, subtext, patterns, and what's unsaid as much as what's said.\n\n### Start with Impression\n\nBefore analyzing anything specific, notice your overall impression. What feeling does this profile give you? Does the person seem warm or cool, serious or playful, open or guarded?\n\nThis gut reaction is information. It's your brain processing hundreds of small signals before you can consciously articulate them. Don't ignore it.\n\n### Look at Everything\n\nDon't just read the bio. Look at all the photos. Read the prompts or questions they answered. Check what they're looking for. Notice the details.\n\nProfiles are curated self-presentations. Everything in them was chosen. That means everything is potentially meaningful.\n\n### Consider the Absences\n\nWhat's *not* in the profile can be as telling as what is.\n\n- No photos with friends? Maybe they're introverted, maybe they're private, or maybe there's something else going on.\n- No mention of what they're looking for? They might not know, or they might be avoiding saying something specific.\n- No humor anywhere? They might not be funny, or they might just be terrible at written humor.\n\nDon't over-interpret absences, but notice them as data points.\n\n### Look for Patterns\n\nDo their photos tell a consistent story or a contradictory one? Does their bio match the vibe of their images? Are the interests they list reflected in what they show?\n\nPatterns suggest authenticity. Contradictions might suggest either complexity or confusion about self-presentation.\n\n---\n\n## What to Look For: Red Flags\n\nRed flags are signals that suggest this person might not be a good match or might cause problems. They're not automatic deal-breakers—context matters—but they're worth noticing.\n\n### Negativity as a Personality\n\nSome bios are primarily defined by what the person *doesn't* want or doesn't like.\n\n\"No games, no drama, no time-wasters. If you can't hold a conversation, don't bother. I'm so done with people who don't know what they want.\"\n\nThis tells you the person has had bad experiences (fair) but has chosen to lead with those grievances (less fair). It suggests they might be carrying baggage into new interactions and might be quick to see problems.\n\n### Vague About Relationship Status\n\nSomeone who's partnered but dating (ethically non-monogamous, poly, etc.) should be clear about that. If they're vague—\"It's complicated\" or \"Ask me about my situation\"—proceed with caution. Vagueness here often signals either that their partner doesn't know they're on the app or that they're hoping you won't ask too many questions.\n\n### Every Photo Is the Same\n\nIf all their photos look identical—same angle, same filter, same expression—you might be seeing someone who's very curated about their image. This isn't automatically bad, but excessive filtering suggests they might be less comfortable with authenticity.\n\nSimilarly, if all photos are heavily filtered or from specific angles that hide aspects of how they actually look, there might be some insecurity about appearance that could affect how they show up in person.\n\n### Lots of Demands, Little Offering\n\nProfiles that read like a requirements list—\"Must be over 6 feet, must have a job, must not have kids, must love dogs...\"—without much about who the person is or what they bring to the table suggest one-sided thinking about relationships.\n\nDating works best as a two-way street. People who think of it primarily as shopping for features may struggle with the give-and-take of real connection.\n\n### Anger at the App or Dating in General\n\n\"I hate this app but here I am\" or \"Dating sucks but I keep trying\" might be relatable, but it's not a great pitch. It suggests someone who's burned out or approaching dating from a place of frustration rather than genuine openness.\n\n### Nothing About Themselves\n\nA profile that only lists external interests—\"I like hiking, cooking, travel, and Netflix\"—without any sense of personality, values, or what they're actually like tells you very little. Either they're not good at self-reflection, or they're not willing to be vulnerable even in a low-stakes context like a profile.\n\n### Excessive Self-Deprecation\n\nA little self-deprecating humor can be charming. A lot of it suggests low self-esteem that might show up in the relationship. \"I don't know why anyone would swipe on me\" or \"I'm terrible at everything\" might be jokes, but they might also be honest expressions of how this person sees themselves.\n\n---\n\n## What to Look For: Green Flags\n\nGreen flags suggest someone who might be a good match—someone who's self-aware, communicative, and genuinely engaged with the dating process.\n\n### Specificity\n\nCompare \"I like music\" to \"I'm currently obsessed with 70s prog rock and I'm not apologizing for it.\" Specificity shows that someone has actual interests, not just socially acceptable hobbies. It also gives you something to talk about.\n\n### Self-Awareness\n\nProfiles that show the person understands themselves—their quirks, their flaws, their patterns—suggest emotional intelligence. \"I'm the friend who always has a book recommendation you didn't ask for\" or \"I'm working on being more spontaneous\" show reflection.\n\n### What They're Looking For\n\nBeing clear about what they want—casual, serious, figuring it out—is a green flag. It suggests honesty and reduces the chance of mismatched expectations.\n\n### Balance of Confidence and Humility\n\nThe best profiles convey, \"I'm good at some things, I'm working on others, I know who I am, and I'm still open to learning.\" This balance is attractive because it's realistic.\n\n### Evidence of Full Life\n\nPhotos and bios that suggest a complete human with interests, friends, and things going on signal that this person isn't looking for a relationship to fill a void. They have a life they're inviting you into.\n\n### Warmth\n\nSome profiles, even through text, convey warmth. They seem kind, curious, genuinely interested in connecting. This is hard to fake and valuable when present.\n\n### Thoughtful Answers to Prompts\n\nIf the app has prompts, look at how they answered them. Did they take them seriously? Are the answers interesting? Did they use them to actually reveal something about themselves?\n\n---\n\n## Conversation Starters\n\nPart of the value of reading profiles well is finding material for conversation. Here's what to look for:\n\n### Unusual Interests or Details\n\nDid they mention something unexpected? A niche hobby? An unusual job? An interest you don't see on every profile? These make the best conversation starters because they invite genuine curiosity.\n\n\"You mentioned you collect vintage lunch boxes—I've never met anyone who does that. How did you get started?\"\n\n### Shared Interests\n\nCommon ground is obvious but effective. If you genuinely share an interest, you can start a real conversation rather than a forced one.\n\n\"Another person who thinks Ursula K. Le Guin is underrated! Which of her books is your favorite?\"\n\n### Things That Raise Questions\n\nAnything ambiguous or intriguing can be a starting point.\n\n\"Your bio mentions you're 'between careers'—that sounds like there's a story there. What's the transition?\"\n\n### Strong Opinions\n\nIf they express a strong opinion, you can engage with it—agreeing, playfully challenging, or asking for elaboration.\n\n\"Bold claim that deep dish isn't real pizza. I'm from Chicago and I'm prepared to defend the casserole. Make your case.\"\n\n### Creative Prompt Answers\n\nIf their prompt answers are interesting, respond to them directly.\n\n\"Your 'worst idea I've ever had' prompt response made me genuinely laugh. Did the bread-making phase ever recover?\"\n\n---\n\n## Reading Between the Lines\n\nBeyond the explicit content, what can you infer?\n\n### Communication Style\n\nHow they write tells you how they communicate. Are they verbose or concise? Casual or formal? Heavy on humor or straight-faced? This is likely how they'll message and talk.\n\nIf your communication styles are wildly different, conversations might feel mismatched even if you're otherwise compatible.\n\n### Relationship with Authenticity\n\nDoes this profile feel genuine or performed? Is the person trying to present an idealized version of themselves, or are they comfortable being human?\n\nPeople who are comfortable with imperfection in their profiles are often comfortable with imperfection in relationships.\n\n### Emotional Availability\n\nSome profiles radiate openness and warmth. Others feel guarded. This can predict how the person will show up in conversation and in dating generally.\n\n### Life Stage and Priorities\n\nWithout explicit age or life-stage markers, you can often tell a lot about where someone is in life from their profile. Are they focused on career? Social life? Settling down? Exploring? This affects compatibility even if no one lists it directly.\n\n### How They See Relationships\n\nDo they talk about what they want to find or what they want to avoid? Do they focus on fun or compatibility? Do they seem to think of dating as adventure or evaluation? These frames affect everything.\n\n---\n\n## Common Profile Patterns\n\nAfter you've read enough profiles, you start to notice types.\n\n### The Over-Curator\n\nEverything is perfect. Every photo is professional quality. The bio is polished like it's been through multiple drafts. This person cares a lot about presentation—maybe to a healthy degree, maybe excessively.\n\n### The Anti-Effort\n\nSingle photo, bio that says \"Just ask\" or nothing at all. Either they're not taking this seriously, they think they're attractive enough that effort isn't required, or they're just bad at apps. Either way, calibrate your expectations.\n\n### The Resume\n\nLists achievements, credentials, travels. Tells you what they've done, not who they are. Often successful people who are more comfortable with accomplishments than vulnerability.\n\n### The Comedian\n\nEvery line is a joke. You might genuinely laugh, but you learn nothing about them as a person. They're using humor as a shield, which might continue into conversation.\n\n### The Romantic\n\nTalks about finding \"the one,\" believing in soulmates, wanting a deep connection. Either genuinely romantic or performing romance as a dating strategy. Hard to tell from a profile alone.\n\n### The Adventurer\n\nEvery photo is from a different country, every interest is active and ambitious. Either genuinely adventurous or curating an exciting image. Again, hard to know without meeting.\n\n### The Genuine Article\n\nA mix of interests, some humor, some sincerity, specific details, authentic photos. This person seems like a real human who put thought into presenting themselves honestly. These are the profiles worth engaging with.\n\n---\n\n## Using What You Find\n\nSo you've read a profile carefully. Now what?\n\n### For Swiping Decisions\n\nUse your reading to make informed decisions. Are there enough green flags and few enough red flags to be worth exploring? Does the profile give you enough to work with for a conversation?\n\nSwipe based on genuine interest, not just attraction to photos.\n\n### For Opening Messages\n\nReference something specific. The more specific, the better. This shows you actually read their profile and found something genuinely interesting.\n\n### For Identifying Compatibility\n\nNotice whether your values, communication styles, and dating goals seem aligned before you invest in a conversation. Some incompatibilities are obvious from profiles—save everyone time by noticing them.\n\n### For First Dates\n\nRemember what you learned. Bring up things from their profile. Ask about interests they mentioned. This shows attention and genuine interest.\n\n### For Red Flags to Monitor\n\nIf you noticed a potential red flag but decided to proceed anyway, keep it in mind. See if it manifests in conversation or on dates. Early skepticism can be useful information.\n\n---\n\n## The Bigger Picture\n\nLearning to read profiles well is really about developing attentiveness—the skill of noticing details, making inferences, and treating the other person as a full human being with complexity.\n\nThis attentiveness serves you beyond dating. It makes you a better conversationalist, a better judge of character, and a more perceptive person in general.\n\nAnd it makes dating itself more interesting. Instead of mindlessly swiping through faces, you're engaging with people's attempts to present themselves. You're looking for genuine connection, not just someone who seems hot enough.\n\nThe irony is that this approach often leads to better matches. When you swipe based on genuine interest in a profile, your conversations start better. When your conversations start better, they're more likely to lead somewhere.\n\nReading profiles well is the first step to connecting well. It's worth learning to do it right.\n",
