Feeld's like system works differently than most dating apps, and the lack of clear documentation leaves many users confused about how their likes function—and whether they're being seen at all.\n\nThis guide answers every common question about likes on Feeld, from the basics of how they work to strategic tips for making them more effective.\n\n---\n\n## How Likes Work on Feeld\n\nLet's start with the fundamentals. Understanding the mechanics helps everything else make sense.\n\n### The Basic Concept\n\nWhen you see someone's profile on Feeld and want to express interest, you can \"like\" them by swiping right or tapping the heart icon. This registers your interest in Feeld's system.\n\nHere's the crucial part: **your like is invisible to the other person unless they also like you back**.\n\nThis is different from some other apps where people can see everyone who's liked them. On Feeld's free tier, likes only become visible through mutual matching.\n\n### What Happens When You Like Someone\n\n1. You like their profile\n2. Your like is stored in Feeld's system\n3. If they eventually see your profile and like you back → you match\n4. If they see your profile and swipe left → no match, and they never knew you liked them\n5. If they never see your profile → your like sits there indefinitely\n\nYour like doesn't disappear or expire (as far as we know). It stays in the queue until one of the above scenarios plays out.\n\n---\n\n## Can You Respond to a Like on Feeld?\n\nThis is the most common question, and the answer requires some nuance.\n\n### On the Free Tier: Not Directly\n\nIf you're using Feeld for free, you can't see a list of people who have liked you. This means you can't \"respond\" to a specific like—you don't know it exists.\n\nWhat you can do:\n- Keep swiping through profiles\n- If you happen to like someone who already liked you, you'll match\n- Pay attention to matches that happen quickly (often means they had already liked you)\n\n### With Majestic (Premium): Yes\n\nFeeld's premium tier, called Majestic, unlocks the ability to see who has liked you. With this feature:\n\n- You get a \"Likes\" section showing profiles that have expressed interest\n- You can browse through these profiles and decide whether to like back\n- Liking them back creates an instant match\n- Swiping left removes them from your likes queue\n\nThis is one of the most valuable Majestic features for many users. It removes the guessing game and lets you focus your energy on people who are already interested.\n\n---\n\n## Can You See Who Liked You?\n\nHere's the breakdown by membership type.\n\n### Free Users\n\nNo. You'll see blurred preview images that indicate \"someone\" has liked you, but you can't see who they are without upgrading. It's a teaser designed to encourage premium subscriptions.\n\n### Majestic Members\n\nYes. You get full access to:\n- Clear photos of everyone who has liked you\n- Their full profile information\n- The ability to like back (match) or pass\n\n### The \"Blurred Photos\" Feature\n\nThose mysterious blurred images in your likes section? They're real people who have actually liked you. Feeld shows you that interest exists without revealing specifics. If you upgrade, those blurs become real, viewable profiles.\n\n---\n\n## Likes vs Pings vs Matches: Understanding the Hierarchy\n\nFeeld has three main ways to express and confirm interest. Understanding how they relate helps you use each effectively.\n\n### The Like\n\n- **Visibility:** Hidden until mutual\n- **Quantity:** Unlimited\n- **Commitment level:** Low\n- **Best for:** General interest, initial filtering\n\nThink of likes as casting a wide net. You can like many people without much consequence because they won't know unless they like you back.\n\n### The Ping\n\n- **Visibility:** Immediately visible to the recipient\n- **Quantity:** Limited (depends on membership tier)\n- **Commitment level:** Medium-high\n- **Best for:** Standing out to someone you're especially interested in\n\nPings are the \"super like\" of Feeld. When you ping someone, they see it in their notifications regardless of whether they've seen your profile yet. It's a way to jump the queue and signal strong interest.\n\n[Read our complete ping guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-ping-guide)\n\n### The Match\n\n- **Visibility:** Both parties see it\n- **Quantity:** Depends on mutual interest\n- **Commitment level:** Confirmed mutual interest\n- **Best for:** Starting actual conversations\n\nA match means both people have liked each other. This unlocks messaging and represents genuine mutual interest.\n\n---\n\n## Common Questions About Feeld Likes\n\n### \"I liked someone but nothing happened\"\n\nSeveral possible explanations:\n\n1. **They haven't seen your profile yet.** On any given day, people only see a fraction of the profiles in their area. Your profile might not have appeared in their feed yet.\n\n2. **They saw you and swiped left.** If they're not interested, they pass without ever knowing you liked them. No notification, no indication.\n\n3. **They're inactive.** Many Feeld users browse sporadically. Someone might not open the app for weeks.\n\n4. **They're overwhelmed.** Popular profiles (especially women and couples looking for thirds) receive enormous amounts of interest. Your like might be one of hundreds.\n\nThe takeaway: a single like is a very passive form of interest. If you want to increase your chances with a specific person, consider using a ping instead.\n\n### \"Can I unlike someone on Feeld?\"\n\nThere's no straightforward \"unlike\" button. However:\n\n- If you accidentally liked someone, your like is invisible to them unless they also like you\n- If you match (they like you back), you can unmatch, which removes the connection\n- Some users report that re-swiping (seeing the same profile later and swiping left) might undo the like, but this isn't officially confirmed\n\nIn practice, accidental likes rarely matter because the other person won't know unless they reciprocate.\n\n### \"Do likes expire?\"\n\nAs of current Feeld functionality, likes don't appear to expire. If you liked someone six months ago and they finally see your profile and like you back, you'll still match.\n\nThis is good news if you're patient, but it also means your like queue might include very old interest that no longer reflects current feelings.\n\n### \"Can I see when someone liked me?\"\n\nNo. Even with Majestic, you don't get timestamps on likes. You see who has liked you, but not when it happened. That like could be from yesterday or three months ago.\n\n### \"Why do I keep seeing the same profiles?\"\n\nFeeld shows you profiles based on your location, preferences, and the algorithm's judgment of compatibility. If you're seeing repeat profiles:\n\n- You might have already swiped on everyone who matches your criteria in your area\n- The algorithm might be re-surfacing profiles you passed on\n- Profiles with updated photos or information get recycled back into the queue\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Use of Likes on Feeld\n\nNow that you understand the mechanics, here's how to use likes effectively.\n\n### Be Generous with Likes, Strategic with Pings\n\nSince likes are unlimited and invisible until mutual, there's little downside to liking liberally. If you're somewhat interested, swipe right. The filtering happens at the match stage.\n\nSave your limited pings for profiles that really excite you—people where you want to maximize your chances of getting noticed.\n\n### Optimize Your Profile for Likes Received\n\nWant more people to like you back? Focus on:\n\n- **Clear, high-quality photos** that show your face and give a sense of your personality\n- **A detailed bio** that gives people something to connect with\n- **Specific desires and interests** that help compatible people recognize you\n- **Authentic presentation** that attracts the right people\n\n[Check out our bio guide for more tips](/feeld-guide/feeld-bio-examples)\n\n### Check Your Likes Section Regularly (If Majestic)\n\nIf you're a premium member, make reviewing your likes a regular habit. These are people who have already expressed interest—your conversion rate will be much higher than with cold swipes.\n\n### Understand That Likes Alone Aren't Enough\n\nIn the Feeld ecosystem, a like is just the first step. It signals \"I might be interested,\" not \"I'm definitely going to pursue this.\" Many users like lots of profiles but only actively engage with a few matches.\n\nIf you want to stand out, focus on what happens after the match: your opening message, your conversation skills, and how you present yourself as someone worth meeting.\n\n---\n\n## Premium Features for Likes: Is Majestic Worth It?\n\nThe ability to see who has liked you is one of Majestic's main selling points. But is it worth the cost?\n\n### Situations Where It's Valuable\n\n- **You're time-limited.** Seeing who's already interested lets you skip the guessing game.\n- **You're getting matches but want more.** Knowing who's in your likes queue helps you understand your \"demand.\"\n- **You're selective.** If you're only going to swipe right on a few people, you might as well prioritize those who've shown interest.\n\n### Situations Where It Might Not Be\n\n- **You're new to Feeld.** You might not have accumulated enough likes yet to justify the cost.\n- **You swipe right frequently.** If you're already liking most profiles, you'll match with your likes through normal swiping anyway.\n- **Your area has limited users.** In smaller markets, you'll eventually see everyone regardless.\n\n[Read our full Majestic review](/feeld-guide/feeld-premium-worth-it)\n\n---\n\n## The Psychology Behind Feeld's Like System\n\nUnderstanding why Feeld designed likes this way helps you work with the system rather than against it.\n\n### Hidden Likes Reduce Rejection Anxiety\n\nBy making likes invisible until mutual, Feeld removes the sting of unrequited interest. You never have to deal with the discomfort of knowing someone saw your like and wasn't interested.\n\n### Mutual Matching Creates Buy-In\n\nWhen both people have actively chosen each other, conversations start on more equal footing. Neither person is \"reaching up\" or \"settling down\"—you've both expressed genuine interest.\n\n### The Premium Incentive\n\nLet's be honest: hidden likes also create a premium upsell opportunity. Feeld is a business, and revealing likes to paying users is one of their main monetization strategies.\n\nWhether you think this is fair or frustrating depends on your perspective. The reality is that this is how the platform works, and understanding it helps you navigate it.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference: Likes on Feeld\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| Can others see my likes? | Only if they like you back (free) or if they have Majestic |\n| Can I see who liked me? | Only with Majestic subscription |\n| Do likes expire? | No, they persist indefinitely |\n| Can I unlike someone? | Not directly, but accidental likes don't matter unless mutual |\n| Like vs ping? | Likes are hidden and unlimited; pings are visible and limited |\n| Does liking increase my visibility? | No direct effect—your profile appears based on other factors |\n\n---\n\n## Not Sure What to Say After Matching?\n\nGetting a match is just the beginning.
