    "raw": "\n\nYour metamour—your partner's partner—has crossed a boundary. Maybe they've said something hurtful, violated an agreement, or affected your relationship with your shared partner.\n\nThis is one of ENM's trickier situations. Here's how to navigate it.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding the Situation\n\n### Types of Metamour Boundary Violations\n\n**Direct violations (with you):**\n- Said something hurtful to you\n- Disrespected your boundaries during interaction\n- Behaved inappropriately toward you\n\n**Indirect violations (affecting you through shared partner):**\n- Pressured partner to break agreements with you\n- Demanded time that was supposed to be yours\n- Acted in ways that affect your relationship negatively\n\n**Systemic violations:**\n- Ignored polycule agreements they're part of\n- Created drama that affects everyone\n- Refused to participate in necessary communication\n\n### Before You Act\n\n**Verify what happened:**\n- Is this a clear boundary violation or a miscommunication?\n- Do you have the full picture?\n- Could there be a reasonable explanation?\n\n**Check your emotional state:**\n- Are you reacting from emotion or clarity?\n- Do you need to cool down first?\n- Is this triggering something beyond the situation?\n\n---\n\n## Who to Talk to First\n\n### Your Partner\n\n**Usually start here.** Your shared partner is your primary channel of communication:\n- They know both of you\n- They can provide context\n- They may need to be involved anyway\n\n**But not always.** Go directly to metamour if:\n- The issue is between you two specifically\n- You have a relationship that includes direct communication\n- Your partner is part of the problem\n\n### The Metamour\n\nConsider talking directly when:\n- You have a positive relationship with them\n- The issue is between you specifically\n- It's a minor misunderstanding\n- Direct communication is established\n\n### Both/Group\n\nFor serious issues affecting everyone:\n- May need group conversation\n- Could involve mediator or therapist\n- Important for polycule-wide agreements\n\n---\n\n## Talking to Your Partner\n\n### Opening the Conversation\n\n**Factual and non-attacking:**\n> \"I need to talk about something that happened with [metamour]. I want to tell you what happened from my perspective and figure out how to address it.\"\n\n**Naming your feelings:**\n> \"Something [metamour] did has been bothering me. I've felt [feeling] since [incident]. I want to talk through it with you.\"\n\n### Describing the Violation\n\n**Be specific:**\n> \"When [specific situation], they [specific behavior]. This crossed a boundary for me because [why it matters].\"\n\n**Avoid:**\n- Character attacks (\"They're so selfish\")\n- Generalizations (\"They always...\")\n- Putting partner in the middle (\"You need to fix them\")\n\n### What You Need\n\n**Ask for specific support:**\n> \"I'd like you to [specific request]. Does that seem reasonable?\"\n\n**Options might include:**\n- \"Talk to them about this on my behalf\"\n- \"Facilitate a conversation between us\"\n- \"Reinforce our agreements with them\"\n- \"Support me in addressing this directly\"\n\n### Sample Conversation\n\n> \"Hey, I need to talk about something. On Saturday, [metamour] made some comments about our relationship that felt really dismissive. When they said [specific quote], it crossed a line for me. I'm not trying to make you choose sides, but I need this addressed. Would you be willing to talk to them about how that affected me, and let me know what they say?\"\n\n---\n\n## Talking to Your Metamour Directly\n\n### When to Go Direct\n\n- You have a reasonable relationship\n- The issue is between you specifically\n- It's something you can resolve together\n- Direct communication is the norm for your situation\n\n### How to Approach\n\n**Request the conversation:**\n> \"Hey, I'd like to talk about something that happened between us. Would you have time for a conversation this week?\"\n\n**In the conversation:**\n\n**1. State what happened (factually):**\n> \"When [situation], you [behavior].\"\n\n**2. Explain the impact:**\n> \"That affected me because [impact].\"\n\n**3. State the boundary:**\n> \"What I need going forward is [boundary].\"\n\n**4. Invite their response:**\n> \"I wanted to bring this up directly. What are your thoughts?\"\n\n### Sample Script\n\n> \"I wanted to talk to you about our conversation last week. When you made the comment about [partner] spending 'too much time' with me, it felt like you were dismissing our relationship. I understand you might have frustrations about time, but I'd appreciate if those concerns went through [partner] rather than being directed at me in that way. Can we agree to that?\"\n\n---\n\n## Handling Different Responses\n\n### If They Apologize Genuinely\n\n> \"I appreciate that. I'd like us to be able to move forward. Thank you for hearing me.\"\n\n### If They Get Defensive\n\n> \"I hear that you have a different perspective. I still need [boundary]. Can we agree on that going forward, even if we see this situation differently?\"\n\n### If They Dismiss Your Concerns\n\n> \"I need you to take this seriously. This is a real boundary for me. If this continues, I'll need to involve [partner] in figuring out how to address it.\"\n\n### If They Attack\n\n> \"This conversation isn't productive. I'm going to step away and revisit this when we can both be calmer.\"\n\n---\n\n## Involving Your Shared Partner\n\n### When Partner Mediation Helps\n\n- The issue isn't getting resolved directly\n- It affects your relationship with them\n- They need to know what's happening\n- Agreements need to be enforced\n\n### How to Ask\n\n> \"I tried talking to [metamour] directly about [issue], but we couldn't resolve it. I need your help navigating this. Can we talk about what to do?\"\n\n### What Partner Can Do\n\n- Talk to metamour about the issue\n- Facilitate a group conversation\n- Reinforce boundaries they share with metamour\n- Support you without taking over\n\n### What Partner Shouldn't Do\n\n- Choose sides blindly\n- Triangulate between you\n- Make it all about them\n- Dismiss either person's concerns\n\n---\n\n## If Your Partner Is the Problem\n\n### When Partner Enables the Violation\n\nSometimes the issue is that your partner:\n- Isn't enforcing your shared agreements\n- Doesn't see the problem\n- Prioritizes metamour over your boundaries\n- Is part of why the violation happened\n\n### Redirecting the Conversation\n\n> \"I hear you defending [metamour]'s perspective, but this is actually about our agreements. When they [behavior], it violated what we agreed to. I need you to address that, regardless of their intentions.\"\n\n### If They Won't Support You\n\n> \"I need to be clear: this boundary matters to me. If you can't support it, we need to have a bigger conversation about our agreements and what they actually mean.\"\n\n---\n\n## Setting Boundaries with Metamours\n\n### You Can Set Limits\n\nEven in non-hierarchical situations, you can:\n- Limit your interaction with metamour\n- Set boundaries about what's shared about you\n- Request they not involve themselves in your relationship\n- Ask for changes to how you all interact\n\n### You Can't Control\n\n- Their relationship with your shared partner\n- How partner spends time with them\n- Their feelings or opinions\n- Partner's choices about them\n\n### The Line\n\nYou can control what directly involves you. You can't control their independent relationship.\n\n---\n\n## When Resolution Isn't Possible\n\n### Living with Imperfect Situations\n\nSometimes you can't fully resolve things:\n- You might need to limit metamour interaction\n- You might carry residual tension\n- Your partner might not handle it the way you wanted\n- The metamour might not change\n\n### Parallel Poly as Solution\n\nIf kitchen table won't work:\n> \"I've tried to resolve this, but I don't think we can have a functional relationship. I'd like to move to more parallel arrangement where we don't interact directly.\"\n\n### When It's a Dealbreaker\n\nIf the metamour situation is untenable and partner won't address it, you may face a choice about the relationship. That's valid, though serious.\n\n---\n\n## Prevention for the Future\n\n### Clear Agreements Upfront\n\nBefore issues arise:\n- What agreements affect metamours?\n- How will violations be handled?\n- What's the process for addressing concerns?\n\n### Regular Check-Ins\n\nDon't wait for problems:\n- How is the polycule dynamic working?\n- Any concerns about metamour interactions?\n- What could be better?\n\n### Establishing Communication Norms\n\nWith metamours you'll interact with:\n- How do we communicate directly?\n- What's the process for concerns?\n- What does respectful interaction look like?\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [ENM Etiquette 101](/enm-communication/enm-etiquette-guide)\n- [Boundary Scripts](/enm-communication/boundary-scripts)\n- [Renegotiating Relationship Agreements](/enm-communication/renegotiation-scripts)\n- [Managing Time with Multiple Partners](/enm-communication/poly-time-systems)\n\n---\n\n## Navigate Complex Dynamics\n\nMetamour relationships add complexity to ENM.
