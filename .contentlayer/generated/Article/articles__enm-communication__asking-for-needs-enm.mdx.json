    "raw": "\nIn monogamy, there's often an unspoken assumption that your partner should just know what you need. In ethical non-monogamy, that assumption will wreck you. Multiple relationships require explicit communication—including clearly asking for what you need.\n\nThis is simple in theory and terrifying in practice. Here's how to do it.\n\n---\n\n## Why Asking for Needs Is Hard\n\n### The Vulnerability Problem\n\nAsking for what you need requires admitting:\n- You need something\n- You can't get it on your own\n- You might be told no\n- The relationship might not meet this need\n\nThat's vulnerable. Most of us avoid vulnerability when we can.\n\n### The ENM-Specific Challenges\n\n**Fear of being \"too much\":**\n- What if my needs make me seem high-maintenance?\n- What if I'm asking for more than I deserve?\n- What if my needs limit my partner's other relationships?\n\n**Comparison anxiety:**\n- What if their other partner doesn't need this?\n- What if I seem needier than their other partners?\n- What if asking creates hierarchy?\n\n**Scarcity fears:**\n- What if there isn't enough time/attention to go around?\n- What if my needs can't be met given their other commitments?\n- What if asking makes clear that I'm not a priority?\n\n### The Mind-Reading Fantasy\n\nMany of us secretly wish partners would just know:\n- \"If they really cared, they'd notice\"\n- \"I shouldn't have to ask\"\n- \"Real connection means intuiting each other's needs\"\n\nThis is a fantasy. Even deeply connected partners can't read minds, especially when juggling multiple relationships.\n\n---\n\n## Identifying Your Needs (Step One)\n\n### Common Categories\n\n**Connection needs:**\n- Quality time\n- Physical affection\n- Emotional intimacy\n- Regular communication\n- Undivided attention\n\n**Security needs:**\n- Reassurance\n- Consistency\n- Follow-through on commitments\n- Transparency about other relationships\n- Future-orientation\n\n**Autonomy needs:**\n- Space for yourself\n- Independence in decisions\n- Time alone\n- Privacy\n- Freedom to grow\n\n**Practical needs:**\n- Help with logistics\n- Financial fairness\n- Schedule coordination\n- Domestic support\n- Shared responsibilities\n\n### Getting Specific\n\n\"I need more time\" is too vague. Get specific:\n\n**Instead of:** \"I need more attention\"\n**Try:** \"I need at least one full day together each week where we're not distracted by phones\"\n\n**Instead of:** \"I need you to communicate more\"\n**Try:** \"I need a goodnight text each night we're not together\"\n\n**Instead of:** \"I need to feel more secure\"\n**Try:** \"I need you to check in with me before making plans that affect our time together\"\n\nSpecific needs are easier to understand and meet.\n\n### Distinguishing Needs from Strategies\n\n**Need:** The underlying thing you require\n**Strategy:** One way to meet that need\n\nExample:\n- **Need:** Connection and intimacy with my partner\n- **Strategy:** Spending every Saturday night together\n\nThe strategy is one option. There might be others. When asking for needs, try to communicate the need while being open to different strategies.\n\n> \"I need more quality connection time with you. Saturdays have worked well for us—would that work going forward? Or is there another way we could create that time?\"\n\n---\n\n## Preparing to Ask\n\n### Check: Is This a Need or a Want?\n\nBoth are valid, but it helps to know which you're expressing:\n\n**Needs:** Essential for your wellbeing and the relationship's health\n**Wants:** Preferences that would enhance things but aren't essential\n\nYou can ask for both—just frame them accordingly:\n- \"I need...\" implies importance and potential dealbreaker\n- \"I'd really like...\" indicates preference with flexibility\n\n### Check: Have You Tried Meeting It Yourself?\n\nSome needs are partner-dependent. Others have self-fulfilling options:\n\n**Partner-dependent:** \"I need emotional intimacy with you\"\n**Potentially self-meeting:** \"I need intellectual stimulation\" (could you also get this from friends?)\n\nThis isn't about suppressing needs—it's about understanding what specifically you need from your partner versus what you can also source elsewhere.\n\n### Check: Is This the Right Partner?\n\nSometimes we ask one partner to meet needs better suited to another:\n- Asking your casual partner for deep emotional processing\n- Expecting your emotionally reserved partner to be your primary support\n- Needing something your partner has expressed they can't give\n\nConsider whether the need matches the relationship.\n\n### Write It Out First\n\nBefore the conversation, write:\n1. What I need: [specific need]\n2. Why it matters: [how it affects you]\n3. What I'm asking for: [specific request]\n4. What I'm open to: [alternatives or flexibility]\n\nThis clarifies your thinking before you speak.\n\n---\n\n## How to Actually Ask\n\n### The Basic Framework\n\n> \"I've realized I need [specific need]. This is important to me because [why it matters]. I'd love to [specific request]. What do you think?\"\n\n### Real Examples\n\n**For more quality time:**\n> \"I've realized I need more one-on-one time with you to feel connected. When we go more than a week without real time together, I start feeling disconnected. Could we commit to at least one full date night every week? I'm flexible on which night.\"\n\n**For more communication:**\n> \"I need more check-ins when we're apart to feel secure in our connection. Even short texts help me feel connected. Would you be open to a good morning and goodnight text on days we don't see each other?\"\n\n**For more reassurance:**\n> \"I've been needing more reassurance lately about where I stand with you, especially with your new relationship taking up a lot of energy. I'm not asking you to do anything differently with them—I just need to hear more explicitly that you value our relationship.\"\n\n**For boundary changes:**\n> \"I need to adjust our agreement about [specific thing]. What we set up initially isn't working for me anymore. Can we talk about what might work better?\"\n\n### What Makes Asking Effective\n\n**Be direct:** Don't hint or hope they'll guess. State it clearly.\n\n**Own it:** These are your needs, not their failures. \"I need\" not \"You should.\"\n\n**Stay curious:** Their response matters. Ask what they think, not just what they'll do.\n\n**Be open to dialogue:** You're starting a conversation, not issuing demands.\n\n---\n\n## Handling Responses\n\n### If They Say Yes\n\n- Thank them genuinely\n- Discuss specifics if needed\n- Follow up to see if it's working\n- Express appreciation when the need is being met\n\n### If They Need Time\n\nSometimes partners need to think:\n> \"I hear what you're asking. I need some time to think about how I can show up for that.\"\n\n**This is reasonable.** Give them space to consider rather than demanding immediate agreement.\n\n### If They Say No\n\nThis is harder. A \"no\" might mean:\n- They can't meet this need (capacity issue)\n- They won't meet this need (willingness issue)\n- They need to discuss alternatives\n- The need conflicts with their other relationships\n\n**How to respond:**\n> \"I appreciate you being honest. Can you help me understand what's getting in the way? I want to see if there's something that works for both of us.\"\n\n### If the Need Can't Be Met\n\nIf after discussion, your need genuinely can't be met in this relationship:\n\n**Options:**\n- Can it be met elsewhere? (Other partner, friend, yourself)\n- Can you adjust your need? (Sometimes needs are actually preferences)\n- Is this a dealbreaker? (Some needs are non-negotiable)\n- Can you accept this limitation? (Not all needs can be met in all relationships)\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n### Apologizing for Having Needs\n\n**Don't:** \"I'm sorry to ask, and I know it's probably too much, but I maybe kind of need...\"\n\n**Do:** \"I've realized I need [thing]. Let's talk about it.\"\n\nHaving needs isn't something to apologize for.\n\n### Framing Needs as Accusations\n\n**Don't:** \"I need you to stop neglecting me.\"\n\n**Do:** \"I need more quality time together. I've been missing our connection.\"\n\nThe first puts them on defense. The second invites collaboration.\n\n### Asking at the Wrong Time\n\nDon't ask for what you need:\n- In the middle of conflict\n- When they're stressed or overwhelmed\n- As they're walking out the door\n- Via text if it's significant\n\nSet up the conversation properly.\n\n### Making It About Their Other Relationships\n\n**Don't:** \"I need you to spend less time with [metamour].\"\n\n**Do:** \"I need more time with you. Can we find ways to create that?\"\n\nFrame needs in terms of what you need with them, not what you need them to do with others.\n\n### Not Asking at All\n\nThe biggest mistake is assuming they know, or suffering in silence, or dropping hints and hoping they'll get it.\n\nIf you need something, ask for it. Directly.\n\n---\n\n## Ongoing Communication\n\n### Regular Check-Ins\n\nDon't wait until needs are unmet to discuss them:\n- Schedule regular relationship check-ins\n- Ask: \"What do you need from me?\"\n- Share: \"Here's what's working and what I need more of\"\n\nPrevention beats crisis.\n\n### Adjusting Over Time\n\nNeeds change. What you needed early in the relationship might differ from now:\n- Life circumstances shift\n- Relationships deepen or stabilize\n- New relationships affect the ecosystem\n- You grow and change\n\nRevisit needs periodically.\n\n### Normalizing the Conversation\n\nThe more you ask for needs, the easier it gets:\n- Small requests build comfort\n- Partners learn you'll communicate directly\n- It becomes part of relationship culture\n- Both of you get better at it\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**What if I don't know what I need?**\nStart with what you're feeling (unhappy, disconnected, anxious). Ask: \"What would make this better?\" Therapy can help with this too.\n\n**What if my needs are \"too much\" for one person?**\nSome needs legitimately exceed one relationship's capacity. That's one reason people are polyamorous—multiple relationships can meet diverse needs.\n\n**What if my partner gets defensive when I ask for things?**\nThat's about their response, not your asking. You can discuss how to raise needs in ways that land better, but you shouldn't have to suppress needs to avoid their discomfort.\n\n**Is it okay to ask for the same thing multiple times?**\nIf a need isn't being met despite previous conversations, yes. But also examine: Are you asking clearly? Are they capable of meeting it? Is there a deeper issue?\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [How to Have Difficult Conversations in Polyamory](/enm-communication/difficult-conversations-poly)\n- [How to Say No to a Partner's ENM Request](/enm-communication/saying-no-to-partner-request)\n- [Processing Big Emotions in Polyamory](/enm-communication/processing-emotions-poly)\n\n---\n\n## Your Needs Matter\n\nAsking for what you need is an act of trust in your relationship.
