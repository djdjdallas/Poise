    "raw": "\nThe scene was intense. Maybe amazing. You felt high, connected, alive. Then—hours or days later—you crash. You feel sad, anxious, weepy, disconnected, or just wrong. What happened?\n\nYou're experiencing drop. It's a real phenomenon that affects both bottoms (sub drop) and tops (dom drop/top drop). Here's what it is and how to handle it.\n\n---\n\n## What Is Drop?\n\n### The Basic Explanation\n\nDuring intense scenes, your body releases a cocktail of chemicals:\n- Endorphins (natural painkillers, euphoria)\n- Adrenaline (energy, alertness)\n- Dopamine (pleasure, reward)\n- Oxytocin (bonding, connection)\n\nThis creates the \"high\" of a good scene—sometimes called \"subspace\" for bottoms.\n\nAfter the scene, these chemicals crash back to normal levels. The drop in these chemicals creates physical and emotional symptoms—what we call \"drop.\"\n\n### Why It Happens\n\nDrop is essentially a chemical hangover. Your body used up its feel-good chemicals and needs time to replenish them.\n\nAdditional factors:\n- Physical exhaustion from the scene\n- Emotional processing\n- Transition from intense connection to separation\n- Return to \"regular life\" after heightened experience\n\n### When It Happens\n\nDrop can occur:\n- Immediately after the scene\n- Hours later (often the next morning)\n- Days later (delayed drop)\n- After leaving your partner's presence\n- When returning to mundane responsibilities\n\nThe timing varies by person and scene intensity.\n\n---\n\n## Sub Drop\n\n### What Sub Drop Feels Like\n\n**Physical symptoms:**\n- Fatigue and exhaustion\n- Flu-like symptoms\n- Headaches\n- Muscle aches\n- Shaking or chills\n- Appetite changes\n\n**Emotional symptoms:**\n- Sadness or depression\n- Anxiety\n- Weepiness\n- Feeling \"off\" or disconnected\n- Neediness or clinginess\n- Irritability\n- Feeling unloved or abandoned\n- Questioning the relationship or dynamic\n\n**Cognitive symptoms:**\n- Difficulty concentrating\n- Feeling \"foggy\"\n- Negative self-talk\n- Ruminating on aspects of the scene\n\n### Why It's Often Worse for Bottoms\n\nBottoms frequently experience more intense drop because:\n- Their bodies produced more endorphins (from pain or intensity)\n- Subspace takes them further from baseline\n- The vulnerability of the role adds emotional dimension\n- Coming back from surrender takes processing\n\n### Managing Sub Drop\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Good aftercare immediately post-scene\n- Staying hydrated and fed\n- Planning for rest after intense scenes\n- Keeping contact with your partner when possible\n\n**When it hits:**\n- Recognize it: \"This is drop, not reality\"\n- Self-care: Rest, comfort food, warm blankets\n- Connection: Reach out to your partner or support people\n- Grounding: Remind yourself this will pass\n- Gentleness: Don't expect productivity or normal functioning\n\n**Communication:**\nTell your partner you're experiencing drop. Good partners want to support you through it.\n\n> \"Hey, I'm hitting some drop from our scene. I'm feeling really sad and disconnected. I could use some reassurance/a check-in/just knowing you're thinking of me.\"\n\n---\n\n## Dom Drop / Top Drop\n\n### What Dom Drop Feels Like\n\n**Physical symptoms:**\n- Exhaustion\n- Feeling physically drained\n- Sleep disruption\n- Appetite changes\n\n**Emotional symptoms:**\n- Guilt about what you did to your partner\n- Worry that you hurt them or went too far\n- Feeling like a bad person\n- Sadness or depression\n- Disconnection\n- Questioning your desires\n\n**Cognitive symptoms:**\n- Ruminating on scenes\n- Second-guessing decisions\n- Negative self-perception\n- Difficulty with normal tasks\n\n### Why Tops Experience Drop\n\nDom drop is often overlooked, but it's real and common:\n\n**Physical causes:**\n- Adrenaline crash\n- Energy expenditure during the scene\n- Focus and attention drain\n\n**Emotional causes:**\n- Responsibility weight\n- Processing having inflicted pain/control on someone you care about\n- Coming down from the power high\n- Returning to egalitarian relating after dominance\n\n**The guilt factor:**\nMany tops experience specific guilt about enjoying causing pain or exercising control. This can feel confusing and shameful, contributing to drop.\n\n### Managing Dom Drop\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Aftercare for tops (yes, you deserve it too)\n- Positive feedback from partners\n- Self-compassion about your desires\n- Planning for rest after scenes\n\n**When it hits:**\n- Recognize it: \"This is drop, not reality\"\n- Seek reassurance: Ask your partner how they're feeling about the scene\n- Self-care: Rest, comfort, activities you enjoy\n- Connection: Talk to community or partners who understand\n- Perspective: Remember that consensual kink is ethical\n\n**Communication:**\nTell your partner you're experiencing drop. You're allowed to need support too.\n\n> \"I'm having some dom drop. I'm feeling guilty about last night even though I know you wanted it. Could you tell me it was good for you?\"\n\n---\n\n## Drop in Different Contexts\n\n### After Intense vs. Light Scenes\n\nMore intense scenes generally produce more intense drop:\n- Heavy pain play → more endorphin crash\n- Deep power exchange → more emotional processing\n- Long scenes → more physical depletion\n\nBut light scenes can also cause drop, especially when emotionally significant.\n\n### After Playing with New Partners\n\nDrop can be more intense with new partners:\n- Less established aftercare routines\n- Uncertainty about checking in\n- Less baseline security to return to\n- More to process about the new experience\n\n### Long-Distance or Separation\n\nWhen partners separate after scenes:\n- Drop often hits harder\n- Connection can't be maintained in person\n- Phone/video check-ins become important\n- Planning for distance is essential\n\n### Planned vs. Unexpected\n\nDrop you expect and plan for is easier to manage than surprise drop days later.\n\n---\n\n## Aftercare That Prevents (or Lessens) Drop\n\n### Immediate Aftercare\n\n**Physical:**\n- Warmth (blankets, body heat)\n- Hydration\n- Food (especially sugar for blood glucose)\n- Physical closeness\n- Gentle touch\n\n**Emotional:**\n- Presence and attention\n- Words of affirmation\n- Reassurance\n- Checking in\n\n### Extended Aftercare\n\n**Hours later:**\n- Check-in texts or calls\n- Continued availability\n- Processing conversation if wanted\n\n**Days later:**\n- Follow-up on how they're feeling\n- Acknowledgment that drop might occur\n- Continued connection\n\n### Self-Aftercare\n\n**For when partner isn't available:**\n- Comfort items (soft things, weighted blankets)\n- Self-soothing activities\n- Connection with friends or support network\n- Rest and gentleness\n\n---\n\n## When Drop Becomes Concerning\n\n### Normal Drop vs. Something More\n\n**Normal drop:**\n- Resolves within hours to a few days\n- Recognizable as drop\n- Responds to care and time\n- Doesn't significantly impair functioning\n\n**Concerning signs:**\n- Lasts more than a few days with no improvement\n- Severe depression or anxiety\n- Thoughts of self-harm\n- Complete inability to function\n- Drop after every scene regardless of intensity\n\n### When to Seek Help\n\nConsider professional support if:\n- Drop is consistently severe\n- It's affecting your ability to engage with life\n- It's making you want to stop kink entirely\n- Underlying mental health conditions might be involved\n\nA kink-aware therapist can help distinguish between drop and other issues.\n\n---\n\n## For Partners: Supporting Someone in Drop\n\n### When Your Partner (Bottom) Is Dropping\n\n**Do:**\n- Check in proactively\n- Offer reassurance they're wanted and valued\n- Be patient with their needs\n- Remind them this is temporary\n- Follow through on aftercare commitments\n\n**Don't:**\n- Dismiss their feelings\n- Take their neediness personally\n- Disappear when they need you\n- Get frustrated with the emotional demands\n\n### When Your Partner (Top) Is Dropping\n\n**Do:**\n- Offer positive feedback about the scene\n- Reassure them they didn't harm you\n- Express gratitude for the experience\n- Be patient with their guilt or doubt\n- Remember they need care too\n\n**Don't:**\n- Assume they don't need aftercare\n- Leave them to process alone\n- Minimize their feelings\n- Forget that tops have emotional needs\n\n---\n\n## Preventing and Minimizing Drop\n\n### Before Play\n\n- Ensure both people are in good baseline state\n- Plan for aftercare\n- Discuss drop history\n- Arrange for post-scene support\n\n### During Play\n\n- Stay hydrated\n- Take breaks as needed\n- Don't push past reasonable limits\n- Maintain connection even in intense scenes\n\n### After Play\n\n- Comprehensive aftercare\n- Planned check-ins\n- Avoid immediate harsh transitions\n- Keep communication open\n\n### Ongoing\n\n- Know your patterns\n- Communicate needs to partners\n- Build reliable aftercare routines\n- Take care of baseline mental health\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Can you have drop without having a great scene?**\nYes. Drop is chemical, not just emotional. Even mediocre or difficult scenes can cause drop.\n\n**Is drop inevitable?**\nNot always. Some scenes don't cause significant drop. Some people rarely experience it. But it's common enough that planning for it is wise.\n\n**Can you drop from vanilla sex?**\nYes, though it's usually less intense. Any intense physical or emotional experience can cause a version of drop.\n\n**What if my partner doesn't believe drop is real?**\nThis is a red flag. Drop is well-documented in the kink community. A partner who dismisses it may not provide adequate aftercare.\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [The Complete Guide to Aftercare](/kink-community/aftercare-guide)\n- [What to Do When a Scene Goes Wrong](/kink-community/when-scene-goes-wrong)\n- [Assessing Kink Compatibility Before Play](/kink-community/kink-compatibility)\n\n---\n\n## Drop Is Temporary\n\nThe crash after the high is real but it passes.
