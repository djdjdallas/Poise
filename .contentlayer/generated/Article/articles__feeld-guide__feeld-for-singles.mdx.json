    "raw": "\n\nYou've heard about Feeld—the dating app for the curious, the open-minded, the ethically non-monogamous. You've also heard it's full of couples. As a single person, you might wonder: is this app even for me?\n\nThe short answer: absolutely, but with caveats. Feeld offers something most dating apps don't—a community that doesn't assume monogamy is the default, that welcomes diverse desires, and that allows you to be explicit about what you want. But navigating it as a single person requires different strategies than what couples use.\n\nThis guide is specifically for singles. How to set up your profile, how to handle the inevitable couple attention, how to find other singles, and how to stay safe while exploring.\n\n---\n\n## Is Feeld Right for You?\n\nBefore diving in, let's figure out if Feeld matches what you're looking for.\n\n### Feeld Might Be Perfect If You:\n\n**Want something beyond mainstream dating**\nFeeld's user base skews toward people who've thought intentionally about relationships—whether that's ENM, kink, queer connections, or just a more open-minded approach to dating.\n\n**Are curious about non-monogamy**\nEven if you're not fully ENM, Feeld is a great place to meet people who are open to various relationship structures.\n\n**Identify somewhere in the LGBTQ+ spectrum**\nFeeld handles gender and orientation with more nuance than most apps, allowing for bi, pan, queer, fluid, and other identities.\n\n**Are interested in kink or exploration**\nThe Desires feature lets you signal interest in specific kinks and experiences in ways mainstream apps don't allow.\n\n**Don't mind couples in your feed**\nYou'll see them. There's no getting around it. If that bothers you, Feeld might frustrate you.\n\n### Feeld Might Not Be Ideal If You:\n\n**Want strictly monogamous connections**\nWhile monogamous people use Feeld, the app's culture skews toward openness. You might find better luck elsewhere.\n\n**Are looking for rapid, high-volume swiping**\nFeeld's user base is smaller and more niche. If you want hundreds of matches quickly, it's not optimized for that.\n\n**Are uncomfortable with explicit desires**\nFeeld users are often more direct about what they want. If that level of openness makes you uncomfortable, consider whether you're ready.\n\n**Have zero interest in ever engaging with couples**\nThey're a significant portion of the user base. You can filter somewhat, but you'll still encounter them.\n\n---\n\n## Setting Up Your Single Profile\n\nYour profile is everything. Here's how to optimize it as a single user on Feeld:\n\n### Photos That Work\n\n**Do include:**\n- Clear face photos (no sunglasses, no group shots as your first photo)\n- Full body photos that represent you accurately\n- Photos showing you doing things you enjoy\n- At least one photo that shows your vibe/personality\n\n**Avoid:**\n- Only selfies\n- Photos where you can't be identified\n- Provocative photos as your first image (save those for later in the gallery if at all)\n- Photos with exes cropped out (we can always tell)\n\n### Writing Your Bio\n\nYour bio should accomplish several things:\n\n**1. Show personality**\nGeneric bios get generic responses. Be specific and let your voice come through.\n\n**2. State what you're looking for**\nAre you open to couples? Only interested in singles? Looking for casual or serious? Be clear.\n\n**3. Include conversation starters**\nGive people something to message you about. A question, a specific interest, an unusual detail.\n\n**Example bio for a single person:**\n> \"Documentary filmmaker, amateur baker, professional overthinker. I'm on Feeld because I'm curious about people who don't fit neatly into boxes—myself included.\n>\n> Looking for singles who are interesting, kind, and can hold a conversation. Open to couples if there's genuine connection with both people and everyone's on the same page about expectations.\n>\n> Currently reading too many books at once and always looking for the best breakfast sandwich in the city. What's your go-to order?\"\n\n### Choosing Your Desires\n\nFor singles, strategic Desire selection helps with filtering:\n\n- Select your genuine relationship style interests (casual, ongoing, etc.)\n- Include specific experiences you're open to\n- If you're open to being a third, you can signal that in Desires\n- Be honest about kink interests if relevant\n\n### Choosing Your Interests\n\nInterests help you connect beyond intimate compatibility:\n\n- Include real hobbies and passions\n- Add specific rather than generic interests\n- Include things that could be date activities\n- Show range across different parts of your life\n\n---\n\n## Handling Couple Attention\n\nIf you're a woman—especially a bisexual woman—you will receive a lot of attention from couples. This is the reality of Feeld. Here's how to handle it:\n\n### If You're Open to Couples\n\n**Screen carefully**\nNot all couples are created equal. Look for:\n- Genuine profiles with individual personality\n- Clear communication about what they're seeking\n- Signs they've done their homework on ethical dating\n- Willingness to see you as a person, not a prop\n\n**Set the pace**\nYou're one person; they're two. Don't let couples rush you. The right couple will match your pace.\n\n**Ask questions**\nBefore meeting, understand:\n- How long have they been ENM?\n- What are their rules and boundaries?\n- Have they done this before?\n- What happened with previous thirds?\n- What are they actually looking for?\n\n**Trust your gut**\nIf something feels off, trust that feeling. There are plenty of couples; you don't need to settle for ones that give you bad vibes.\n\n### If You're Not Open to Couples\n\n**State it in your bio**\nBe clear: \"Single seeking singles only\" saves everyone time.\n\n**Use filters when available**\nFeeld's Majestic (premium) tier allows more filtering options.\n\n**Decline politely**\nA simple \"Thanks, but I'm focusing on connecting with singles right now\" is fine.\n\n**Don't feel obligated**\nYou don't owe anyone your time or attention, regardless of how nicely they message you.\n\n### Navigating Unicorn Status\n\nIf you identify as a unicorn (a bisexual person, often a woman, who dates couples), some specific considerations:\n\n**You have value**\nGood unicorns are sought after. Don't settle for couples who don't treat you well.\n\n**State your expectations**\nWhat do you need to feel valued? Communication between dates? Inclusion in planning? Make it clear.\n\n**Avoid couple privilege dynamics**\nWatch for couples who prioritize each other at your expense or treat you as a \"guest\" in their relationship.\n\n**Develop unicorn community**\nOther unicorns can be great sources of support, advice, and referrals for good couples.\n\n---\n\n## Finding Other Singles\n\nCouples dominate many Feeld feeds. Here's how to find other single users:\n\n### Profile Signals\n\nLook for:\n- Profiles that don't mention a partner\n- Individuals who aren't linked to another profile\n- People who explicitly mention seeking other singles\n- Solo photos without wedding rings or couple references\n\n### Use Filters\n\nFeeld's filtering capabilities help:\n- Filter by relationship status if available\n- Focus on specific genders/orientations that align with what you're seeking\n- Narrow geographic range for more relevant results\n\n### Be Patient\n\nThe single-to-couple ratio varies by location and time, but couples generally outnumber singles on Feeld. Accept that you'll likely see more couple profiles than single ones.\n\n### Consider Premium\n\nMajestic membership offers additional filters and features that can help you find singles more efficiently.\n\n### Look for ENM Singles\n\nMany singles on Feeld are in open or poly relationships but dating separately. They might be listed as \"single\" but have a partner who's also dating. If that works for you, it expands your pool significantly.\n\n---\n\n## Safety for Singles on Feeld\n\nSafety applies to any dating app, but there are Feeld-specific considerations:\n\n### Privacy Settings\n\n**Hide from friends/contacts:** Feeld offers options to reduce the chance of matching with people in your phone contacts. Use this if privacy matters.\n\n**Control your visibility:** Adjust settings for who can see your profile and when.\n\n**Photo privacy:** Consider what your photos reveal about your identity and location.\n\n### Identifying Fakes and Scams\n\n**Red flags for fake profiles:**\n- Too few photos or only professional-quality images\n- Immediate escalation to off-app messaging\n- Vague profiles with no specific details\n- Pressure to share personal information early\n- Suspicious link-sharing\n\n**Red flags for problematic couples:**\n- One partner is clearly not involved or enthusiastic\n- Refusal to video chat before meeting\n- Pressure to meet immediately\n- Unwillingness to answer basic questions\n- Requests for explicit photos before meeting\n\n### Meeting Safely\n\n**General rules apply:**\n- First meetings in public places\n- Tell someone where you're going\n- Have your own transportation\n- Trust your instincts\n\n**Special considerations for meeting couples:**\n- Meet both partners together first\n- Don't go to their home for a first meeting\n- Be cautious about private settings until you've built trust\n- Have a check-in plan with a friend\n\n---\n\n## Making Feeld Work for You\n\nHere are strategies for single users to maximize their Feeld experience:\n\n### Approach It as a Different Experience\n\nFeeld isn't Tinder or Hinge with extra features. It's a different culture with different expectations. Approach it with curiosity rather than frustration.\n\n### Be More Intentional\n\nWith a smaller user base, quality matters more than quantity. Take time with profiles you're interested in, and send thoughtful messages.\n\n### Embrace the Specificity\n\nFeeld allows you to be explicit about what you want in ways other apps don't. Use that. The more specific you are, the better your matches will be.\n\n### Engage with the Community\n\nFeeld users often attend the same events, know each other through ENM communities, and overlap in social circles. You're joining a community, not just an app.\n\n### Be Open to Learning\n\nYou'll encounter relationship structures and desires you might not have known existed. Stay curious and open rather than judgmental.\n\n### Manage Expectations\n\nYou might not get as many matches as on mainstream apps. The matches you do get are often higher quality and more aligned with what you actually want.\n\n---\n\n## Special Situations\n\n### If You're New to ENM\n\nFeeld is a great place to learn, but be honest about your experience level:\n\n- State in your bio that you're new to ENM\n- Ask questions when you don't understand terms\n- Go slow and communicate clearly\n- Read up on ENM concepts (relationship anarchy, kitchen table poly, etc.)\n\n### If You're Questioning Your Orientation\n\nFeeld is welcoming to people who are exploring. You can signal \"curious\" or \"questioning\" in your profile, and the community generally meets that with openness.\n\n### If You're Kink-Curious but Inexperienced\n\nSimilar to ENM, be honest:\n\n- State that you're curious but new\n- Seek partners who are patient and experienced\n- Communicate extensively before engaging in any new activities\n- Take things slow\n\n### If You're Traveling\n\nFeeld works well for travelers:\n\n- Adjust your location settings\n- Be clear in your bio that you're visiting\n- Specify if you're looking for one-time or ongoing\n- Look for locals who are experienced with travelers\n\n---\n\n## Common Single User Experiences\n\n### \"I'm Overwhelmed by Couple Messages\"\n\nYou're not alone. Options:\n- Adjust bio to clarify preferences\n- Decline politely and move on\n- Take breaks from the app when it feels like too much\n- Consider premium for better filtering\n\n### \"I Can't Find Other Singles\"\n\nTry:\n- Expanding geographic range\n- Being more patient with the process\n- Actively seeking ENM community events\n- Using other apps alongside Feeld\n\n### \"The App Seems Slow\"\n\nFeeld's user base is smaller and more niche. This often means:\n- Fewer but more relevant matches\n- Slower but more intentional conversations\n- Less noise but also less volume\n\n### \"I'm Not Sure How to Respond to ENM Profiles\"\n\nIf someone is in an open relationship but dating separately:\n- Treat them as you would any individual\n- Understand their situation but don't obsess over their partner\n- Ask questions about their relationship structure if unclear\n- Respect any boundaries they've communicated\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nFeeld can be an incredible app for singles—if you understand what you're walking into and approach it strategically. It's a space for the curious, the open-minded, and those who don't quite fit the mainstream dating mold.\n\nThe couple attention can be overwhelming if you're not prepared for it. But with clear profile communication, solid filtering, and appropriate boundaries, you can find exactly the kinds of connections you're looking for.\n\nWhether that's other singles who share your interests, couples you genuinely connect with, or simply a community that gets you—Feeld has something to offer. The key is knowing what you want and being clear about it.\n\n---\n\n## Need Help Standing Out on Feeld?\n\nPoise helps you craft profiles that attract the right people and write messages that start real conversations.
