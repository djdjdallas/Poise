    "raw": "\n\nYour Feeld bio isn't just another dating profile. It's your chance to signal exactly who you are and what you're looking for to an audience that actually gets it. Unlike mainstream apps where you're playing it safe, Feeld rewards specificity, honesty, and personality.\n\nThe problem? Most people freeze up when it's time to write theirs. They either go too vague (\"Just looking for connections!\") or overshare in ways that feel more like a terms of service than an invitation.\n\nWe analyzed hundreds of successful Feeld profiles to bring you 50 bio examples that actually work—organized by who you are and what you're seeking. These aren't just templates to copy; they're frameworks you can adapt to sound like *you*.\n\n## What Makes a Great Feeld Bio\n\nBefore we dive into examples, let's break down the anatomy of a bio that gets responses. The best Feeld bios have four elements:\n\n### 1. The Hook\nYour first line matters most. It should be intriguing, specific, or unexpected enough that someone wants to keep reading. Generic openers like \"Hey, I'm [name]\" waste precious real estate.\n\n### 2. Identity Markers\nWho are you? Not just your relationship structure, but what makes you *you*. Your interests, your vibe, your energy. People on Feeld are looking for specific connections—help them find you.\n\n### 3. Clear Intent\nWhat are you actually looking for? Feeld users appreciate directness. You don't need to list every scenario you're open to, but clarity about your primary intent helps the right people reach out.\n\n### 4. The Invitation\nEnd with something that makes messaging you easy. A question, a prompt, a specific interest people can respond to. The best bios make the other person think, \"I know exactly what to say to them.\"\n\n---\n\n## For Singles Seeking Singles\n\nThese bios work for solo users primarily interested in connecting with other individuals.\n\n### Example 1: The Curiosity-Driven Opener\n> **The last thing that genuinely surprised me:** how much I liked fermented foods after years of being suspicious of them.\n>\n> Designer by day, amateur ceramicist by weekend. I make things with my hands and think too much about fonts.\n>\n> Looking for someone who has opinions about things—what you're reading, what you're cooking, what's keeping you up at night. Casual but consistent connection is the sweet spot.\n>\n> Tell me the last thing you changed your mind about.\n\n**Why it works:** Specific, shows personality, ends with an easy conversation starter.\n\n### Example 2: The Direct and Warm\n> **Not here to waste anyone's time, including my own.**\n>\n> 34, queer, works in climate tech. I take my work seriously but not myself. Currently into: long bike rides, mediocre poetry, and hosting dinner parties where the conversation gets unexpectedly deep.\n>\n> Looking for dates that feel like hanging out with someone you already like. Chemistry first, labels later.\n>\n> If you're also in your \"figure out what I actually want\" era, we'll probably get along.\n\n**Why it works:** Clear about what they want without being rigid, relatable vulnerability.\n\n### Example 3: The Playful and Specific\n> **Things I will absolutely do on a first date:** make you a cocktail based on your vibe, show you my plant collection, ask you at least one question you've never been asked before.\n>\n> Things I won't do: pretend I'm not nervous.\n>\n> 29, bi, probably overthinking this bio right now. Work in publishing, which means I read a lot and have opinions about book covers.\n>\n> Looking for people who are curious and kind. The rest is negotiable.\n\n**Why it works:** Charming, shows self-awareness, gives clear picture of what a date would be like.\n\n### Example 4: The Understated Confidence\n> **I know what I like.** Good conversation, morning runs, red wine on weekdays, people who are direct about what they want.\n>\n> Software engineer, but I promise I'm not boring. I cook elaborate meals for one and am trying to learn jazz piano badly.\n>\n> Here for something real, not sure what shape that takes yet. Open to exploring with someone who's also figured out the basics of being a person.\n\n**Why it works:** Confidence without arrogance, specific interests create connection points.\n\n### Example 5: The Vulnerable and Grounded\n> **The honest version:** I'm newly single after a long relationship and I'm taking the intentional route back to dating.\n>\n> Not looking for rebound energy—I've done my processing. Just genuinely curious about meeting new people and seeing what develops.\n>\n> I'm a therapist (yes, I've examined this choice), I hike more than is probably healthy, and I make excellent scrambled eggs.\n>\n> Looking for chemistry, emotional intelligence, and someone who laughs at their own jokes.\n\n**Why it works:** Honesty about situation builds trust, profession implies emotional competence.\n\n### Example 6: The Minimal but Magnetic\n> **Art director. Aquarius rising. Makes very strong espresso.**\n>\n> I'm better in person.\n>\n> Looking for someone interesting to do interesting things with. If you have a niche obsession, I want to hear about it.\n\n**Why it works:** Confident, creates intrigue, invitation is clear and low-pressure.\n\n### Example 7: The Warmly Intellectual\n> **Currently reading three books at once and finishing none of them.**\n>\n> I work in documentary film, which means I'm good at asking questions and genuinely interested in most people's stories.\n>\n> 32, she/her, demisexual-ish (attraction grows for me). Looking for connections that start with conversation and see where it goes.\n>\n> Very into: live music, long walks where we solve each other's problems, breakfast sandwiches.\n>\n> What's the thing you're most excited about right now?\n\n**Why it works:** Labels are explained naturally, interests feel authentic and specific.\n\n### Example 8: The Charmingly Self-Aware\n> **My friends describe me as:** \"intense but in a good way\"\n>\n> I have a lot of energy for the things I care about, which currently includes urban planning (I know), making pasta from scratch, and finding the best dive bars.\n>\n> 27, he/him, mostly dates women but open to being surprised.\n>\n> Looking for: someone I can debate with over cheap beer and then make out with. In that order.\n\n**Why it works:** Self-awareness is attractive, very clear about what a connection would look like.\n\n---\n\n## For Singles Open to Couples\n\nThese bios work for individuals who are open to connecting with couples, whether as a unicorn, third, or ongoing connection.\n\n### Example 9: The Experienced Third\n> **Yes, I date couples. No, it's not what you saw in that movie.**\n>\n> I've been part of the ENM community for 4 years and genuinely enjoy the dynamic of connecting with partners. The best experiences have been with couples who've done their work, communicate well, and treat me like a full person rather than an accessory.\n>\n> Also very much into dating singles. I just like dating.\n>\n> 31, bi woman, marketing manager by day. Into: rock climbing, thrift stores, and people who can hold a conversation.\n>\n> Couples: tell me about your dynamic and what you're hoping for. Singles: tell me about your current obsession.\n\n**Why it works:** Establishes experience and boundaries, welcoming to both couples and singles.\n\n### Example 10: The Curious Newcomer\n> **New to Feeld, genuinely curious about everything.**\n>\n> I've always been drawn to non-traditional relationship dynamics but never really explored. Starting with an open mind and clear communication.\n>\n> Open to couples where there's genuine connection with both people—not interested in being a prop for someone else's fantasy, but very interested in mutual exploration.\n>\n> 28, queer, works in UX. I make spreadsheets for fun (organizing is my love language) and I'm an excellent plus-one to any event.\n>\n> What should I know that isn't in the FAQ?\n\n**Why it works:** Honest about experience level, shows thoughtfulness about what they want.\n\n### Example 11: The Selective and Clear\n> **I don't date every couple that asks.** I date couples where I feel genuine chemistry with both partners and where everyone's on the same page.\n>\n> What I'm looking for: emotional connection, good communication, and ideally something ongoing rather than one-time. I catch feelings and I'm not apologizing for it.\n>\n> 29, she/her, photographer. My calendar is full of projects I'm excited about and I'm looking for people to be equally excited about.\n>\n> Tell me something real.\n\n**Why it works:** Sets clear boundaries without being cold, knows what they want.\n\n### Example 12: The Flexible Explorer\n> **Equally happy with a solo coffee date or a couples game night.**\n>\n> I'm not attached to any particular dynamic—I'm attached to genuine connection. That's shown up in different forms and I've enjoyed learning what works for me.\n>\n> Currently: 32, bi, working on a dissertation about climate communication. I'm a little scattered but in an endearing way (I think).\n>\n> Looking for people who are curious, communicative, and don't take themselves too seriously.\n\n**Why it works:** Flexibility feels genuine, personality shines through.\n\n### Example 13: The Direct Invitation\n> **To couples reading this:** I'm interested in connection, not in being a secret or an experiment. If you're both excited about meeting me for me, let's talk.\n>\n> **To everyone else:** I'm a 27-year-old software developer who's way too into houseplants and indie games. Looking for chemistry and conversation in whatever form it takes.\n>\n> I make really good playlists and I remember what you tell me.\n\n**Why it works:** Addresses couples directly without alienating singles, shows thoughtfulness.\n\n### Example 14: The Emotionally Available\n> **Not here to be your relationship band-aid.**\n>\n> But if you're a couple who's genuinely solid and looking to expand your world—or a single person who's emotionally intelligent and interesting—I'm interested.\n>\n> 30, nonbinary, they/them. I work in nonprofit arts administration and care a lot about making the world slightly less terrible.\n>\n> Looking for: intellectual connection, physical chemistry, and people who can talk about their feelings without a flowchart.\n\n**Why it works:** Clear boundaries, values are evident, invitation is warm.\n\n### Example 15: The Experience-Focused\n> **I've learned I care less about the structure and more about how it feels.**\n>\n> Some of my best connections have been with couples. Some have been solo. The common thread: mutual respect, genuine attraction, and good conversation.\n>\n> 35, bi woman, runs a small bakery (yes, I'll make you bread). Very tactile, very curious, very much looking for people who know themselves.\n>\n> What does your ideal Saturday look like?\n\n**Why it works:** Mature perspective, specific question invites engagement.\n\n### Example 16: The Boundaries-Forward\n> **Things I'm great at:** third wheel (the good kind), parallel play, being the calm in someone else's chaos.\n>\n> **Things I'm not here for:** unicorn hunting that doesn't consider my needs, one-time experiences disguised as \"seeing where it goes.\"\n>\n> 26, queer, works in film production. I have chaotic energy but healthy boundaries.\n>\n> Looking for couples who date as a team but see me as an individual. Also into singles who appreciate that I have a weird schedule.\n\n**Why it works:** Humor mixed with clear boundaries, self-aware.\n\n---\n\n## For Couples Together\n\nThese bios work for couples who date as a unit and create a shared profile.\n\n### Example 17: The Warm Introduction\n> **We're Maya (34) and Jordan (36).** Together 8 years, ENM for 3. We've done the work, had the conversations, and are genuinely excited about meeting new people.\n>\n> **Her:** Marketing, obsessed with true crime podcasts, the organized one.\n> **Him:** Architect, makes the best tacos you've ever had, the spontaneous one.\n>\n> Looking for: a genuine connection with someone who's interested in both of us, not just the idea of us. We move slow, communicate a lot, and prioritize everyone's comfort.\n>\n> We know what we're asking isn't simple. Tell us what questions you have.\n\n**Why it works:** Both personalities shine, acknowledges complexity, invitation is welcoming.\n\n### Example 18: The Playful Partners\n> **Married, not dead.**\n>\n> We're Sophie and Alex, mid-30s, and we genuinely like each other (weird, we know). We opened our relationship because life's too short and interesting people are everywhere.\n>\n> Our vibe: competitive board games, farmers markets, cooking elaborate meals, and conversations that accidentally get deep.\n>\n> Looking for a unicorn who isn't actually a unicorn—just a real person we both genuinely connect with.\n>\n> Tell us about the last thing you geeked out about.\n\n**Why it works:** Humor establishes their dynamic, \"unicorn who isn't a unicorn\" shows awareness.\n\n### Example 19: The Experience-Clear\n> **We know what works for us now.**\n>\n> After a few years in ENM, we've learned we're looking for ongoing connection rather than one-night things. Someone who becomes part of our lives in whatever way develops naturally.\n>\n> **About us:** Both 30, both bi, both work in healthcare. We balance each other out—she's the planner, he goes with the flow.\n>\n> Our ideal? Finding someone who wants to get dinner, watch a terrible movie with us, and see where the night goes. No pressure, lots of communication.\n\n**Why it works:** Experience shows, clear about what they want, low-pressure invitation.\n\n### Example 20: The Kitchen Table Poly\n> **We do kitchen table poly.** Our partners become part of our extended world, not secret side characters.\n>\n> **She/her:** 38, professor, runner, makes excellent cocktails\n> **He/him:** 40, writer, homebody, makes excellent breakfast\n>\n> Looking for connection that includes all the normal stuff—hanging out, texting, being part of each other's lives. We're less interested in hookups than in building something.\n>\n> Currently reading, watching, and listening to too much to list here. What's on your current rotation?\n\n**Why it works:** Relationship style is clear, interests invite conversation.\n\n### Example 21: The New Explorers\n> **This is new for us.** We're not pretending otherwise.\n>\n> Together 5 years, just started exploring ENM. We've been reading, talking, and moving slowly. Now we're ready to actually meet people and see what connection feels like.\n>\n> **Us:** Both early 30s, both introverts, both work too much (tech industry, guilty as charged).\n>\n> Looking for someone patient who doesn't mind being part of our learning curve—and who's looking to learn alongside us.\n>\n> We're nervous about this. Probably you are too?\n\n**Why it works:** Honesty about experience level builds trust, vulnerability is relatable.\n\n### Example 22: The Enthusiastic Hosts\n> **We throw a really good dinner party.**\n>\n> And that's kind of our dating energy too—we like bringing people into our world, making them feel welcome, and seeing what develops.\n>\n> **About us:** 32 and 35, married, ENM for 2 years. She's in nonprofit fundraising, he's a middle school teacher (yes, he has infinite patience).\n>\n> Looking for a third who wants to actually be part of things—holidays, game nights, lazy Sundays. We're interested in something real, not a checked box.\n>\n> What makes you feel most yourself?\n\n**Why it works:** Metaphor captures their energy, question invites genuine response.\n\n### Example 23: The Clearly Boundaried\n> **What you should know upfront:**\n> - We only date together\n> - We're looking for something ongoing\n> - We won't pressure you into anything\n> - We'll ask lots of questions because consent is sexy\n>\n> **Who we are:** 29F and 31M, together 6 years, gym rats, taco enthusiasts, and surprisingly good at karaoke.\n>\n> We've been lucky to meet some amazing people on here. Hoping you might be next.\n\n**Why it works:** Boundaries feel protective rather than restrictive, personality still comes through.\n\n### Example 24: The Comfortable in Complexity\n> **We're a couple who dates together.** We know that's complicated—it requires more communication, more intentionality, and more trust.\n>\n> We're into it anyway.\n>\n> **Her:** 37, she/her, therapist (so yes, we've processed everything), loves hiking and horror movies.\n> **Him:** 39, he/him, chef (will cook for you), loves bad puns and good whiskey.\n>\n> Looking for someone who wants genuine connection with both of us, someone we can text during the day and see on weekends. We don't need it to look any particular way—just to feel real.\n\n**Why it works:** Acknowledges complexity thoughtfully, clear picture of their lives.\n\n---\n\n## For Couples Dating Separately\n\nThese bios work for coupled individuals who date independently, with their own profile.\n\n### Example 25: The Married and Individual\n> **Married 10 years. Dating separately for 3.**\n>\n> My wife is my favorite person, and she's not on this app. We do our own thing and come home happy.\n>\n> I'm James, 38, he/him. I work in renewable energy and have way too many hobbies—currently cycling, woodworking, and failing at chess.\n>\n> Looking for: my own connections, whatever form they take. I've got relationship bandwidth and I'm not trying to replace anyone.\n>\n> Ask me about the weirdest thing I've built.\n\n**Why it works:** Situation is clear, personality and interests shine through.\n\n### Example 26: The Clear Communicator\n> **Here on my own, with my partner's full enthusiasm.**\n>\n> We've been ENM for 4 years and date separately. He's not on Feeld (apps aren't his thing). We're well-communicated and I'm here with full autonomy to explore my own connections.\n>\n> I'm a 33-year-old bi woman who works in data science. I'm nerdy, outdoorsy, and really good at deep conversations over wine.\n>\n> Looking for: people who appreciate that I'm coupled but see me as a whole person. Casual or ongoing, I'm open.\n>\n> What's the last rabbit hole you fell down?\n\n**Why it works:** Transparency about structure, clear she's operating independently.\n\n### Example 27: The Parallel Lives\n> **Partnered. She has her dating life, I have mine.**\n>\n> We call it parallel poly and it works for us. I'm not looking for someone to \"meet my wife\" (unless that's what develops)—I'm looking for my own relationship.\n>\n> 36, nonbinary, they/them. UX researcher who gets way too interested in how people make decisions. Very into: film photography, fermenting things, and asking too many questions.\n>\n> I can offer: genuine attention, good conversation, and my full presence when we're together.\n\n**Why it works:** Relationship structure explained clearly, clear offer.\n\n### Example 28: The Settled and Seeking\n> **Happily partnered. Also happily dating.**\n>\n> My boyfriend and I have been together 5 years, open for most of that. We live together, share a cat, and do our own thing when it comes to dating.\n>\n> I'm 29, she/her, work in events management (which means I'm good at logistics and bad at relaxing). Looking for connections that are their own thing—I'm not comparing anyone to my partner.\n>\n> I'm funny, I promise. It just doesn't come through in bios.\n\n**Why it works:** Humor, clear about autonomy, relatable self-deprecation.\n\n### Example 29: The New to Solo\n> **First time dating separately.**\n>\n> My partner and I have dated as a couple before, but I realized I wanted to explore on my own too. They're fully supportive (and also on here, doing their thing).\n>\n> I'm 31, bi, working in nonprofit communications. I'm figuring out what I want my dating life to look like as an individual again.\n>\n> Looking for: patient people who are okay with some uncertainty. I'm emotionally available, just navigating new terrain.\n\n**Why it works:** Honesty about situation, clear about current state.\n\n### Example 30: The Established Autonomy\n> **What my solo poly life looks like:** I have a nesting partner, I date on my own, we tell each other about our days.\n>\n> No hierarchy drama, no veto power. Just adults figuring it out.\n>\n> I'm 40, he/him, work in architecture. I have a whole life that includes running, record collecting, and spending too much money at bookstores.\n>\n> Looking for connections that don't need to fit a template. What's your template-breaking thing?\n\n**Why it works:** Clear philosophy, mature perspective, engaging question.\n\n---\n\n## For ENM/Poly People\n\nThese bios work for people in ethical non-monogamous or polyamorous relationships of various configurations.\n\n### Example 31: The Relationship Anarchist\n> **Labels I use:** relationship anarchist, queer, probably neurodivergent.\n>\n> **What that means in practice:** I don't rank my relationships. I let each connection be what it wants to be. I'm interested in intimacy that doesn't follow a script.\n>\n> 28, they/them, work as a bartender and artist. I have a long-term partner and several close connections that defy easy categorization.\n>\n> Looking for: people who are curious about connection rather than certain about what it should look like.\n\n**Why it works:** Terms are explained, philosophy is clear, invitation is open.\n\n### Example 32: The Experienced Poly\n> **10 years in poly relationships. Still figuring it out.**\n>\n> I have a partner of 7 years and have had various other relationships in that time. Currently not dating anyone else and looking to change that.\n>\n> 35, bi woman, elementary school teacher (the patience transfers). I'm a planner, a texter, and someone who shows up when I say I will.\n>\n> Looking for: something that has room to grow. I have the bandwidth for a real relationship, not just dates.\n\n**Why it works:** Experience is clear, shows reliability, clear about capacity.\n\n### Example 33: The Solo Poly\n> **Solo poly = my own home, my own life, my own choices.**\n>\n> I'm not looking for a nesting partner. I'm looking for meaningful connections that don't require us to merge lives to be valuable.\n>\n> 38, she/they, work as a nurse. I have my routines, my people, and my independence. I'm looking for someone who wants to be part of that, not upend it.\n>\n> Good at: texting consistently, planning dates, showing up emotionally.\n> Working on: being patient with people who communicate differently.\n\n**Why it works:** Solo poly explained practically, self-awareness is attractive.\n\n### Example 34: The Thoughtful Newcomer\n> **New to practicing poly, not new to thinking about it.**\n>\n> I've been in monogamous relationships that felt restrictive and I've finally decided to date in a way that aligns with how I actually think about love—which is that I have a lot of it.\n>\n> 32, he/him, software developer. Currently single and building my community from the ground up.\n>\n> Looking for: other people exploring this, or experienced folks who remember what the learning curve feels like.\n\n**Why it works:** Honest about experience level, thoughtful framing, clear about what would help.\n\n### Example 35: The Kitchen Table Enthusiast\n> **My ideal: everyone can be in the same room.**\n>\n> I practice kitchen table poly because I like when my partners know each other, when metamours can chat, when it all feels like community rather than compartments.\n>\n> 34, queer, she/her, work in policy. I have a partner of 4 years and we're both dating separately.\n>\n> Looking for people who want to actually be part of a life, not a hidden part of it.\n\n**Why it works:** Relationship style explained with values, clear invitation.\n\n### Example 36: The Polycule Navigator\n> **Current situation:** partnered, and part of a larger network of people who care about each other.\n>\n> I'm 29, nonbinary, work as a therapist. My partner and I practice hierarchical poly—I'm honest about that. They're my priority, but I have genuine space and energy for additional relationships.\n>\n> Looking for: someone who's comfortable being important but not primary. It's not about ranking—it's about capacity and logistics.\n\n**Why it works:** Honest about hierarchy, explains practically rather than defensively.\n\n### Example 37: The Anchor Partner\n> **I have an anchor partner. Looking for more anchors.**\n>\n> I believe in multiple committed relationships, not primary/secondary dynamics. Right now I have one serious partner and I'm looking for more—not something casual, something real.\n>\n> 36, bi, he/him, work in nonprofit management. I have time, energy, and emotional bandwidth for more love in my life.\n>\n> If you're also looking for something significant, let's talk.\n\n**Why it works:** Clear philosophy, knows what they want, direct invitation.\n\n### Example 38: The Network Builder\n> **Less interested in relationship structures, more interested in relationship quality.**\n>\n> I date people, some of those people date other people, we all try to be kind and communicate. That's about as much structure as I've got.\n>\n> 27, queer, they/them, work as a barista while I figure out my next career move. I'm messy, I'm earnest, I make really good playlists.\n>\n> Looking for connections that are their own thing. Tell me about yours.\n\n**Why it works:** Philosophy is relaxed and welcoming, personality shines through.\n\n---\n\n## For Kink-Curious/Kink-Focused\n\nThese bios work for people whose primary interest is kink exploration, or who want to signal kink-friendliness.\n\n### Example 39: The Kink-Curious\n> **Curious about things I can't quite name yet.**\n>\n> I'm at the beginning of exploring kink. I've done the reading, joined some communities, had some conversations. Now I'm looking for people to actually explore with.\n>\n> 26, she/her, bi, work in marketing. Very enthusiastic, very communicative, very much a beginner.\n>\n> Looking for: patient people who remember what curiosity feels like. Happy to discuss limits and desires—I just don't have the vocabulary yet.\n\n**Why it works:** Honest about experience, shows initiative and communication skills.\n\n### Example 40: The Experienced and Welcoming\n> **Happy to help you figure it out.**\n>\n> I've been in the kink community for 8 years. I've explored, taught, and learned a lot about what I want and how to ask for it.\n>\n> Now I'm interested in meeting curious people—whether experienced or just starting out. The common thread: genuine interest, good communication, and respect for boundaries.\n>\n> 35, queer, they/them, work as a writer. Interests include: impact play, rope, and conversations that build trust.\n>\n> Tell me what you're curious about. There are no wrong answers.\n\n**Why it works:** Experience frames as welcoming rather than intimidating, clear interests.\n\n### Example 41: The Submissive\n> **Looking for someone to give my attention to.**\n>\n> I'm a submissive who values the dynamic as much as the scenes. I want to be useful, attentive, and genuinely present for someone.\n>\n> 29, she/her, work in tech. Outside of this, I'm competent and confident. Inside of this, I want to let that go.\n>\n> Interested in: service, protocol, praise. Requires: respect, communication, consistency.\n>\n> What would you do with my attention?\n\n**Why it works:** Clear about what they offer and require, compelling question.\n\n### Example 42: The Dominant\n> **I know what I want. Let's see if our wants align.**\n>\n> I'm a dominant who's interested in real dynamic, not just bedroom play. I value obedience, communication, and genuine connection.\n>\n> 40, he/him, work in finance. Yes, I can switch between boardroom and dungeon. Yes, it's the same skillset.\n>\n> Looking for: submissives who want to be led, not controlled. Structure that serves us both.\n>\n> Tell me about the last time you felt truly held.\n\n**Why it works:** Confidence without arrogance, humor, clear philosophy.\n\n### Example 43: The Explorer\n> **My kinks are a work in progress.**\n>\n> I've tried a lot, liked most of it, and am still discovering what really resonates. Currently interested in: power exchange, sensory play, and anything that requires trust.\n>\n> 31, bi, they/them, work as a designer. I'm creative, communicative, and enthusiastic about figuring things out together.\n>\n> Looking for fellow explorers. The more we talk, the more we'll discover.\n\n**Why it works:** Openness is inviting, emphasis on exploration and communication.\n\n### Example 44: The Switch\n> **Depends on the day. Depends on you.**\n>\n> I'm a switch who genuinely enjoys both sides—not just tolerating one to access the other. I love the dance of figuring out the dynamic.\n>\n> 33, queer, she/her, librarian (yes, we're all freaks). Into: rope, impact, elaborate negotiations.\n>\n> Looking for: flexible people who want to explore rather than script. Let's see what we become together.\n\n**Why it works:** Humor, clear about switch identity, enticing invitation.\n\n---\n\n## For Introverts/Anxious Daters\n\nThese bios work for people who want to signal that they're more low-key or nervous about the process.\n\n### Example 45: The Nervous and Honest\n> **I'm probably overthinking this bio right now.**\n>\n> Dating makes me anxious. I'm on Feeld anyway because I want to meet people and I've accepted that discomfort is part of that process.\n>\n> 28, she/her, data analyst. I'm quiet until I'm not. I need warmup time but I promise there's a personality here.\n>\n> Looking for: patient people who don't mind doing some of the conversational lifting at first. I'll catch up.\n\n**Why it works:** Vulnerability is disarming, sets realistic expectations.\n\n### Example 46: The Slow Mover\n> **I take my time.**\n>\n> Not because I'm playing games—because that's how I work. I need to feel safe before I feel attracted. I need conversation before I need to meet.\n>\n> 35, he/him, demisexual, work in museum curation. I'm into art, history, and deep dives into niche topics.\n>\n> Looking for: people who understand that slow doesn't mean uninterested. I'm very interested. I'm just careful.\n\n**Why it works:** Explains pace without apologizing, demisexual framed practically.\n\n### Example 47: The Introverted Enthusiast\n> **My ideal date: one interesting person, one cozy bar, one conversation that makes me forget I'm supposed to be making small talk.**\n>\n> I'm an introvert who's selectively social. The right person energizes me. The wrong crowd drains me. Feeld seems like it attracts the right people.\n>\n> 30, bi, nonbinary, work as a therapist. I'm good at asking questions and genuinely want to know your answers.\n>\n> Looking for: quality over quantity. One good connection beats ten mediocre ones.\n\n**Why it works:** Explains introversion positively, shows genuine interest.\n\n### Example 48: The Homebody\n> **Full disclosure: I'd rather stay in.**\n>\n> I'll go out for the right person, but my natural habitat is my couch with a book and a cat. If that sounds boring, we're probably not a match.\n>\n> 32, she/her, work as a writer. I'm funny over text, I make good playlists, and I'm excellent at comfortable silence.\n>\n> Looking for: someone to be cozy with. That's really it.\n\n**Why it works:** Clear about lifestyle, filters effectively, appealing to right people.\n\n### Example 49: The Recovering Perfectionist\n> **I used to wait until I was ready. Turns out I was never going to be ready.**\n>\n> So here I am, imperfect bio, imperfect photos, probably going to stumble through first conversations.\n>\n> 27, he/him, engineer. I'm better in person than on apps, but I'm doing my best here.\n>\n> Looking for: people who appreciate effort over polish. I'm trying.\n\n**Why it works:** Relatable, vulnerable, lowers the stakes for conversation.\n\n### Example 50: The Low-Pressure Request\n> **No pressure. Really.**\n>\n> I know dating apps can feel like a lot. I'm not here to add to that pressure.\n>\n> 29, queer, they/them, work in education. I'm just looking for connections with nice people. Casual is fine. Slow is fine. Just being friendly is fine.\n>\n> If you want to chat about whatever, I'm easy to talk to.\n\n**Why it works:** Creates a safe, low-pressure vibe that appeals to anxious daters.\n\n---\n\n## What to Avoid: Bio Red Flags\n\nBefore you start crafting your bio, know what to steer clear of:\n\n**The Negatives List**\n> \"No flakes, no drama, no games, no time-wasters\"\n\nThis tells people what you don't want but nothing about who you are. It also suggests you've had bad experiences and might be bringing that baggage to new connections.\n\n**The Ultimatum**\n> \"If you can't hold a conversation, swipe left\"\n\nAggressive gatekeeping is a turnoff. Trust people to self-select.\n\n**The Menu Order**\n> \"Looking for a hot bi girl who's fit, funny, down for anything, and available on weekends\"\n\nYou're describing a person like a product specification. It feels dehumanizing.\n\n**The Copy-Paste**\n> \"Just ask :)\"\n\nThis isn't a bio. It's a non-bio. Give people literally anything to work with.\n\n**The Overshare**\n> [Detailed sexual fantasies, trauma history, or relationship drama in the first paragraph]\n\nThere's a time for sharing these things. Your bio isn't it.\n\n---\n\n## How to Customize These Templates\n\nThese examples work because they follow the structure (Hook + Identity + Intent + Invitation) while sounding like real people. Here's how to make them yours:\n\n### 1. Start with Your Hook\nWhat's the most interesting, specific, or unexpected thing about you? Lead with that. Not \"I'm fun to be around\"—but \"I once taught myself taxidermy during a breakup.\"\n\n### 2. Add Your Real Interests\nDon't say \"I like music.\" Say \"I'm currently obsessed with 90s Japanese city pop.\" Specificity creates connection points.\n\n### 3. Be Clear About What You Want\nDon't hedge. If you're looking for casual, say casual. If you want something ongoing, say that. Ambiguity doesn't help anyone.\n\n### 4. End with a Question\nGive people an easy way to start a conversation. The best questions are specific but not intrusive.\n\n### 5. Read It Out Loud\nIf it doesn't sound like you talking, revise. Your bio should feel like the text version of your actual voice.\n\n---\n\n## Feeling Overwhelmed?\n\nWriting about yourself is hard. That's why Poise exists.\n\nOur AI dating assistant helps you craft authentic messages, from bios to openers to replies. Because you shouldn't have to be a writer to find connection.\n\n[Download Poise and take the pressure off.](/download)\n",
