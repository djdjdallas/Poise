    "raw": "\nYou matched with someone on Feeld and their profile indicates kink interests. Maybe they've listed desires, maybe they mentioned something in their bio, or maybe their photos suggest a certain aesthetic.\n\nHow do you actually bring it up? How do you discuss kink early without being creepy or making assumptions?\n\nHere's how to navigate kink conversations on Feeld from the very first message.\n\n---\n\n## The Balance to Strike\n\n### Not Too Much, Too Fast\n\nEven on a kink-friendly app:\n- Leading with graphic sexual content is off-putting\n- Assuming immediate compatibility is presumptuous\n- Detailed scene proposals in the first message are too much\n\n### Not Too Little, Forever\n\nOn the other hand:\n- Avoiding the topic entirely wastes time\n- Dancing around it creates confusion\n- You're both here partly because of these interests\n\n### The Goal\n\nTalk about kink early enough to assess compatibility, respectfully enough to build trust, and explicitly enough to actually be useful.\n\n---\n\n## Opening the Kink Conversation\n\n### When Their Profile Mentions It\n\n**If they've listed desires or mentioned kink:**\n\n> \"I noticed we have some overlapping interests listed. I'm curious about your experience with [general category]—have you been exploring this for a while?\"\n\n> \"Your desires list caught my eye—some good overlaps there. What's been most interesting to explore for you?\"\n\n> \"I saw you mentioned [thing in bio]. I've always been curious about that. What draws you to it?\"\n\n### When It's Implied But Not Explicit\n\n**If their profile hints at it:**\n\n> \"Your profile gives me the sense you're into more than vanilla. Am I reading that right?\"\n\n> \"Something about your profile suggests we might be on the same wavelength. Are you exploring kink, or am I misreading?\"\n\n### When You're Not Sure\n\n**Feeling out their interest:**\n\n> \"I'm curious what brings you to Feeld specifically—this app tends to attract a certain kind of person.\"\n\n> \"What are you hoping to find here? I know Feeld attracts different crowds.\"\n\n---\n\n## Discussing Specific Interests\n\n### General to Specific\n\nStart with categories, move to details:\n\n**First:**\n> \"I see you're interested in power dynamics. That's something I've been exploring too.\"\n\n**Then:**\n> \"What does that look like for you? D/s, more primal, something else?\"\n\n**Eventually:**\n> \"I'm curious about your experience with [specific thing]. Is that something you're actively exploring?\"\n\n### Sharing Your Own\n\nBalance questions with disclosure:\n\n> \"I'm pretty into [general category]. Specifically, I've been exploring [slightly more specific]. Is that territory you're interested in?\"\n\n> \"My main interests are around [area]. How does that align with what you're looking for?\"\n\n### The Yes/No/Maybe Approach\n\nFor efficient compatibility:\n\n> \"Have you ever done a yes/no/maybe list? I find it's a useful way to compare interests without a lot of awkward dancing around.\"\n\n> \"Would you be open to sharing what you're into more explicitly? I'm happy to share my interests too.\"\n\n---\n\n## Example Conversations\n\n### Conversation 1: Stated Desire Match\n\n**Her profile lists:** Bondage, rope, sensation play\n\n**Your opener:**\n> \"I saw rope in your desires—that's something I've been practicing for a while. What's your experience with it? Do you prefer tying or being tied?\"\n\n**Her response:**\n> \"Being tied, definitely. I've done some rope but want to explore more. What kind of rope do you work with?\"\n\n**Your follow-up:**\n> \"I mostly work with jute, though I have some cotton for longer sessions. What appeals to you about rope specifically? The aesthetic, the restriction, something else?\"\n\n### Conversation 2: Subtle Profile Hint\n\n**Her profile mentions:** \"looking for someone who takes control\"\n\n**Your opener:**\n> \"Your profile caught my attention—the bit about someone who takes control resonated. Are you exploring D/s dynamics, or something more casual?\"\n\n**Her response:**\n> \"Somewhere in between maybe? I like confidence and assertiveness, not sure I'm ready for full protocols and stuff.\"\n\n**Your follow-up:**\n> \"That makes sense. What does 'taking control' look like in your ideal scenario? I want to make sure we're imagining similar things.\"\n\n### Conversation 3: Exploring Together\n\n**Her profile says:** \"curious about kink but new to all this\"\n\n**Your opener:**\n> \"I appreciate the honesty about being new to kink. What sparked your curiosity?\"\n\n**Her response:**\n> \"I've always had these fantasies but never explored them. Not sure where to start.\"\n\n**Your follow-up:**\n> \"That's a great place to be—curious and open. If you're comfortable sharing, what kind of fantasies have you had? I promise no judgment.\"\n\n---\n\n## What to Avoid\n\n### Going Too Graphic Too Fast\n\n❌ \"I want to tie you up and [detailed scene description]\"\n❌ \"What's the kinkiest thing you've done?\"\n❌ \"Send pics in [specific kink context]\"\n\nEven when you're both clearly kinky, these messages feel presumptuous and objectifying.\n\n### Making Assumptions\n\n❌ \"So you're a sub, right?\"\n❌ \"I can tell you like pain\"\n❌ \"You must be into [thing]\"\n\nAsk, don't assume. Even obvious-seeming interests deserve conversation.\n\n### Treating Kink as the Only Topic\n\n❌ Only talking about kink, never about them as a person\n\nKink compatibility matters, but so does personal compatibility. Balance the conversation.\n\n### Demanding Disclosure\n\n❌ \"Tell me all your kinks right now\"\n❌ \"You need to share your limits before we talk more\"\n\nDisclosure should happen at a pace comfortable for both people.\n\n---\n\n## Navigating Mismatches\n\n### When Interests Don't Align\n\n**If you discover incompatibility:**\n\n> \"Thanks for being open about what you're into. It sounds like we might be looking for different things—I'm more interested in [your thing] and it sounds like you're more [their thing]. Does that seem like a gap we can work with?\"\n\n**If it's a fundamental mismatch:**\n\n> \"I appreciate you sharing. It seems like we're looking for pretty different dynamics. I think we might not be the right match for each other kink-wise. Wishing you well in finding what you're looking for!\"\n\n### When They're More Experienced\n\n**If they're more experienced than you:**\n\n> \"I have to be honest—I'm less experienced than you with this. I'm genuinely interested in learning, though. Would you be open to exploring with someone at my level?\"\n\n### When They're Less Experienced\n\n**If you're more experienced:**\n\n> \"I've been doing this for a while, so I'm happy to take things at whatever pace works for you. What would feel comfortable for getting to know each other's interests?\"\n\n---\n\n## Building Toward Meeting\n\n### Assessing Compatibility\n\nBefore meeting, ensure you've covered:\n- General kink interests and roles\n- Deal-breaker limits on either side\n- What you're both hoping for from the connection\n- Enough conversation to trust meeting in person\n\n### Proposing the Meeting\n\n> \"I've really enjoyed getting to know your interests. I'd love to continue this in person—maybe we could grab coffee and see if the chemistry is there before talking about anything more specific?\"\n\n> \"It seems like we might be compatible. Would you be interested in meeting up? I'm thinking somewhere public first—I take consent and vetting seriously.\"\n\n### The First Meeting Isn't a Scene\n\nSet expectations:\n\n> \"Just to be clear, I'm suggesting we meet to get to know each other—not play right away. I want to make sure we're actually compatible before going there.\"\n\n---\n\n## Safety Considerations\n\n### Vetting Before Meeting\n\n- Ask about their experience\n- Look for red flags in how they discuss consent\n- Check if they're known in community (if applicable)\n- Trust your instincts\n\n### Don't Share Everything Immediately\n\n- Disclosure can happen gradually\n- You don't owe your entire kink history upfront\n- Some information is best shared after meeting\n\n### Watch for Red Flags\n\n- Pressure to meet before you're ready\n- Dismissing consent discussions\n- Vague about their own experience\n- Pushing past boundaries in conversation\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**How explicit should I be in early messages?**\nExplicit enough to assess basic compatibility, not so explicit that you're describing detailed scenes. General categories and interests before specifics.\n\n**What if they're into something I'm not?**\nAcknowledge it honestly. \"That's not my area of interest, but I'm glad you shared.\"\n\n**Should I share my limits early?**\nHard limits can be shared relatively early. Softer negotiations can wait for more established connection.\n\n**What if our kinks are the same but in opposite directions?**\nTwo dominants or two submissives might not be scene-compatible. Discuss whether this is workable for both of you.\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [How to Discuss Kink with a New Partner](/kink-community/discussing-kink-new-partner)\n- [Assessing Kink Compatibility Before Play](/kink-community/kink-compatibility)\n- [30 Feeld Conversation Starters That Actually Work](/feeld-guide/feeld-conversation-starters)\n\n---\n\n## Talk About What You Want\n\nKink conversations take courage, but they're essential for finding compatible partners.
