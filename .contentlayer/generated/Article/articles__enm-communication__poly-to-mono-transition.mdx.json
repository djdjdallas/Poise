    "raw": "\nYou've been polyamorous. Now you're considering monogamy—either with a current partner or as you enter new relationships. This isn't failure. It's choosing what works for your life right now.\n\nHere's how to navigate the transition thoughtfully.\n\n---\n\n## Why People Choose Monogamy After Poly\n\n### Valid Reasons to Close\n\n**Life circumstances:**\n- Not enough time/energy for multiple relationships\n- Career demands\n- Parenting needs\n- Health changes\n- Moving to area with no poly community\n\n**Relationship evolution:**\n- Want to deepen with one person\n- Found someone you want exclusivity with\n- Current relationship needs full focus\n- Ready for different life phase\n\n**Personal realization:**\n- Polyamory isn't for you\n- Tried it, learned about yourself\n- Prefer monogamy fundamentally\n- Emotional bandwidth limits\n\n### What It's Not\n\n**This isn't:**\n- Admitting poly \"doesn't work\"\n- Saying monogamy is \"better\"\n- Failure of any kind\n- Judgment on others who stay poly\n\n**It's simply:**\n- Choosing what fits your life now\n- Evolving as a person\n- Honoring your needs\n- Making intentional choices\n\n---\n\n## Closing a Relationship with a Partner\n\n### The Conversation\n\n**If you want monogamy with your current partner:**\n\n> \"I've been doing a lot of thinking about what I need, and I'm realizing I want to focus entirely on us. I want to talk about what moving toward monogamy could look like for us.\"\n\n**Be clear about:**\n- This is what you need\n- You're not demanding, you're sharing\n- You want to explore this together\n- Their feelings matter too\n\n### When You Don't Agree\n\n**If one wants mono and one wants poly:**\n- This is a fundamental incompatibility\n- Neither is wrong\n- May require difficult choices\n- Compromise rarely works long-term\n\n**Options:**\n- One partner shifts (only if genuinely willing)\n- Relationship ends\n- Finding middle ground (rarely sustainable)\n\n### Timeline for Closing\n\n**If you agree to close:**\n- Don't demand immediate action\n- Allow time for existing relationships\n- Gradual transition is kinder\n- Set clear milestones\n\n**Example timeline:**\n- Week 1-2: Conversations with other partners\n- Month 1-3: Wind down existing relationships\n- Month 3+: Fully closed\n- Adjust based on circumstances\n\n---\n\n## Ending Other Relationships\n\n### Having the Conversation\n\n**With other partners:**\n> \"I need to share something difficult. [Partner] and I have decided to close our relationship. This means I need to end our romantic relationship. This isn't about you—it's about changes I need in my life.\"\n\n**Be honest about:**\n- Why you're closing\n- That you value what you had\n- The timeline\n- Whether friendship is possible\n\n### Different Situations\n\n**If it was casual:**\n- Clear communication still matters\n- Gratitude for the connection\n- Clean ending\n\n**If it was serious:**\n- More conversation needed\n- Allow for their feelings\n- May require multiple talks\n- Consider their transition needs too\n\n**If they're in love with you:**\n- This will hurt\n- Be compassionate but clear\n- Don't give false hope\n- Allow space for grief\n\n### Your Own Grief\n\n**Expect to feel:**\n- Sadness about ending connections\n- Guilt about hurting others\n- Relief mixed with loss\n- Questioning your decision\n\n**This is normal.** Choosing monogamy doesn't mean you didn't value those relationships.\n\n---\n\n## Entering Monogamy with Intention\n\n### Not \"Default\" Monogamy\n\n**Choose monogamy actively:**\n- Know why you're choosing this\n- What does monogamy mean to you?\n- What boundaries does it include?\n- What are the expectations?\n\n**Avoid:**\n- Assuming it's \"normal\" so no discussion needed\n- Unspoken expectations\n- Resentment from either side\n- Treating it as restriction vs. choice\n\n### Defining Your Monogamy\n\n**Questions to discuss:**\n- What counts as \"cheating\"?\n- Flirting—okay or not?\n- Emotional intimacy with others?\n- Porn, camming, etc.?\n- What if feelings develop for someone else?\n\n### Carrying Poly Skills Forward\n\n**You've learned:**\n- Communication skills\n- How to articulate needs\n- Emotional processing\n- Handling jealousy\n- Relationship intentionality\n\n**These serve monogamy too.** Don't lose what you've learned.\n\n---\n\n## When Starting Fresh\n\n### Dating as Formerly Poly\n\n**Disclosure questions:**\n- Do you tell new partners about your poly past?\n- When do you bring it up?\n- How do you frame it?\n\n**Our take:**\n- You don't owe your dating history\n- If it's relevant, share when comfortable\n- Frame it positively (not as failure)\n- Be clear about your current desires\n\n### Finding Compatible Partners\n\n**If seeking monogamous partners:**\n- Be clear in your profiles\n- State what you're looking for\n- Don't hide your past, but don't lead with it\n- Screen for shared values\n\n### Handling Questions\n\n**If they ask about your poly past:**\n> \"I explored polyamory for a few years. It taught me a lot about myself and relationships. Now I know I want monogamy, and I'm looking for someone who wants that too.\"\n\n---\n\n## Processing the Transition\n\n### Identity Shift\n\n**If \"poly\" was part of your identity:**\n- This takes adjustment\n- You're not betraying anything\n- Identity can evolve\n- You're still you\n\n### Community Changes\n\n**You may:**\n- Lose some poly friendships\n- Feel disconnected from community\n- Need to find new social circles\n- Miss aspects of poly life\n\n### Lingering Doubts\n\n**Common thoughts:**\n- \"Am I giving up something important?\"\n- \"What if I regret this?\"\n- \"Does this mean poly was wrong for me?\"\n\n**Helpful reframe:**\n- Polyamory served you when it did\n- Life phases change\n- Choosing mono now doesn't invalidate poly past\n- You can always reassess later\n\n---\n\n## Challenges You Might Face\n\n### Missing the Variety\n\n**If you miss:**\n- Different connection types\n- NRE and new experiences\n- The poly community\n- Specific people\n\n**What helps:**\n- Grieving what you're giving up\n- Focusing on what you're gaining\n- Deepening current relationship\n- Finding variety within monogamy\n\n### Resentment Risk\n\n**Watch for:**\n- Blaming partner if closing was \"for them\"\n- Feeling restricted\n- Comparing unfavorably to poly life\n- Counting what you gave up\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Own your choice\n- Don't make your partner responsible\n- Address resentment immediately\n- Consider therapy if needed\n\n### Partner Insecurity\n\n**Your mono partner may:**\n- Wonder if you'll want poly again\n- Feel insecure about your past\n- Need extra reassurance\n- Question your commitment\n\n**How to help:**\n- Consistent reassurance\n- Transparency about feelings\n- Patience with their concerns\n- Clear communication\n\n---\n\n## If You Chose Mono for a Partner\n\n### The Risk\n\n**If you don't actually want monogamy:**\n- Resentment will build\n- You may feel trapped\n- Relationship may suffer\n- Breakup often eventual\n\n### Making It Work\n\n**If you genuinely chose this:**\n- Remind yourself it was your choice\n- Focus on benefits\n- Communicate when struggling\n- Don't martyr yourself\n\n### When It's Not Working\n\n**Signs to reassess:**\n- Constant resentment\n- Feeling like a sacrifice\n- Longing that doesn't fade\n- Breaking agreements\n\n**You may need to:**\n- Renegotiate\n- Accept incompatibility\n- Be honest about needs\n- Make difficult choices\n\n---\n\n## Keeping the Door Open\n\n### \"Mono for Now\"\n\n**Some people:**\n- Choose monogamy for this relationship\n- Remain open to poly in future\n- Don't identify as \"monogamous\" permanently\n\n**This is valid if:**\n- Your partner knows\n- You're not waiting for escape\n- You're genuinely present now\n- It's honest, not hedging\n\n### If Feelings Change\n\n**If you want to explore poly again:**\n- Have honest conversations\n- Don't cheat\n- Recognize this may end current relationship\n- Your needs matter\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Is wanting monogamy after poly a sign I was never \"really\" poly?**\nNo. You can genuinely be poly for a period and genuinely want monogamy later. People and needs change.\n\n**How do I tell my poly friends I'm going mono?**\nHonestly and without apology. Real friends will support your choices even if they'd choose differently.\n\n**My partner wants to close but I don't. What are my options?**\nYou can close (if you genuinely can accept it), stay open unilaterally (rarely works), or end the relationship. There's no magic compromise.\n\n**Will mono feel restrictive after poly?**\nIt might at first. The adjustment takes time. Focus on what you're gaining, not just what you're giving up.\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [How to Break Up in Polyamory (Ethically)](/enm-communication/poly-breakup-guide)\n- [How to Deescalate a Relationship Without Ending It](/enm-communication/deescalating-relationship)\n- [What Successful ENM Actually Looks Like](/enm-communication/enm-success-stories)\n\n---\n\n## There's No Wrong Path\n\nPolyamory isn't inherently better than monogamy—they're different relationship structures for different people at different times.
