    "raw": "\nYou're polyamorous. You matched with someone who's also poly. That shared context is a starting point, but it's not enough on its own—there are many ways to do polyamory, and compatibility isn't guaranteed just because you both have multiple relationships.\n\nHere's how to open conversations with fellow poly people in ways that lead to genuine connection.\n\n---\n\n## Why Poly-to-Poly Conversations Are Different\n\n### Shared Context, Different Practices\n\nBoth being poly means:\n- You don't have to explain the basics\n- You can skip the \"are they okay with this?\" questions\n- You understand scheduling and meta dynamics\n\nBut poly varies widely:\n- Hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical\n- Kitchen table vs. parallel\n- Established polycule vs. solo poly\n- Relationship anarchist vs. structured poly\n\n### What You Need to Discover\n\nBeyond basic interest:\n- How do they practice poly?\n- What are they looking for (another serious partner, casual, connection)?\n- How does their existing structure affect available space?\n- What's their relationship bandwidth?\n\n### The Advantage\n\nWith fellow poly people, you can:\n- Have more direct conversations about structure\n- Ask about things vanilla folks wouldn't understand\n- Skip past common misconceptions\n- Build on shared vocabulary and values\n\n---\n\n## Opening Messages That Work\n\n### Acknowledge the Poly Connection\n\n**Simple acknowledgment:**\n\n> \"Hey! Fellow poly person here. Always nice to match with someone who gets it. What's been your experience on Feeld?\"\n\n> \"I noticed you're poly too—what does your relationship setup look like?\"\n\n> \"Another polyamorous human! I'm curious what you're looking for on here.\"\n\n### Ask About Their Style\n\n**Understanding their approach:**\n\n> \"How would you describe your poly style? I'm [hierarchical/non-hierarchical/RA/etc.] and curious if we're compatible.\"\n\n> \"Do you practice kitchen table or parallel? I find that affects compatibility a lot.\"\n\n> \"How long have you been doing polyamory? I'm always curious about people's journeys.\"\n\n### Share Your Situation\n\n**Opening with context:**\n\n> \"I'm poly with [brief description—e.g., 'a nesting partner' or 'two long-term partners' or 'practicing solo poly']. Curious what your situation looks like.\"\n\n> \"I'm in [situation] and looking for [type of connection]. What brings you to Feeld?\"\n\n### Find Common Ground\n\n**Beyond just poly:**\n\n> \"Poly AND into [interest from their profile]? That's a combination I don't see often. What draws you to [interest]?\"\n\n> \"I see we're both poly and both into [shared interest]. Tell me more about your experience with that.\"\n\n---\n\n## Navigating Structure Questions\n\n### Asking About Their Setup\n\n**Respectful inquiries:**\n\n> \"What does your polycule look like? I'm always curious how others structure things.\"\n\n> \"Do you have a primary partner, or do you practice non-hierarchical poly?\"\n\n> \"What does your current relationship configuration look like? I want to understand what you have space for.\"\n\n### Sharing Your Setup\n\n**Clear but not overwhelming:**\n\n> \"Quick context on me: I have [partner(s)], we've been [timeframe], and I'm looking for [type of connection]. Happy to share more.\"\n\n> \"I practice [style], which means [brief explanation of what that looks like for you].\"\n\n### Discussing Available Space\n\n**What capacity do they have:**\n\n> \"What kind of connection are you looking for? I know poly folks have different amounts of bandwidth depending on existing relationships.\"\n\n> \"How much space do you have for a new connection? I'm looking for someone with [level of availability you want].\"\n\n---\n\n## Example Conversations\n\n### Conversation 1: Finding Connection Type\n\n**Your opener:**\n> \"Hey! I see you're poly too. What are you hoping to find on Feeld—another serious relationship, something more casual, or just seeing what develops?\"\n\n**Their response:**\n> \"Honestly, I'm pretty saturated for serious partnerships right now, but I'm open to more casual connection with the right person. What about you?\"\n\n**Your follow-up:**\n> \"That actually works well for me. I'm also not looking for another primary-level relationship—more like meaningful connections that don't require the same level of integration. What does casual but meaningful look like to you?\"\n\n### Conversation 2: Understanding Structure\n\n**Your opener:**\n> \"Fellow poly person! What's your setup look like? I'm curious about compatibility.\"\n\n**Their response:**\n> \"I have a nesting partner of 5 years and a boyfriend of about 6 months. Non-hierarchical in principle, though practically my nesting partner gets more time. You?\"\n\n**Your follow-up:**\n> \"I'm solo poly, so a bit different structure—no nesting partner, intentionally. I'm curious how that would work for you? Some partnered poly folks aren't sure what to do with solo poly people.\"\n\n### Conversation 3: Shared Journey\n\n**Your opener:**\n> \"Your profile mentions being poly—how long have you been practicing? I'm always curious about different paths into this.\"\n\n**Their response:**\n> \"About three years now. Started when my partner and I opened up. It's been quite a journey. You?\"\n\n**Your follow-up:**\n> \"I've been at it for two years, though mine started from solo discovery. It's interesting how differently people come to poly. What's been the biggest learning curve for you?\"\n\n---\n\n## Topics to Explore\n\n### Their Poly Philosophy\n\n- What does ethical non-monogamy mean to them?\n- How do they handle jealousy and insecurity?\n- What's their communication style?\n- How do they feel about relationship hierarchies?\n\n### Their Practical Setup\n\n- What relationships do they currently have?\n- How much time do they realistically have?\n- How involved are their partners in meeting new connections?\n- What does their metamour situation look like?\n\n### What They're Looking For\n\n- Another anchor partner or something casual?\n- Specific type of connection (romantic, sexual, companionate)?\n- How would a new relationship fit into their life?\n- What's working in their current setup, and what's missing?\n\n### Compatibility Markers\n\n- Similar relationship philosophy\n- Compatible time and energy availability\n- Mutual understanding of what each person is offering\n- Aligned expectations about connection depth\n\n---\n\n## What to Avoid\n\n### Assuming All Poly Is the Same\n\n❌ \"So your partner's fine with this, obviously\"\n❌ \"You must be into [assumption about poly people]\"\n❌ \"All poly people are like [generalization]\"\n\nAsk about their specific situation instead.\n\n### Interrogation Mode\n\n❌ Firing off questions without sharing about yourself\n❌ Making them feel like they're being vetted\n❌ Not building rapport alongside gathering information\n\nBalance questions with conversation.\n\n### Relationship Resume Dump\n\n❌ Listing every relationship you've ever had\n❌ Detailed history of your poly journey when they asked a simple question\n❌ Making the conversation about your past rather than potential connection\n\nKeep context concise; elaborate when asked.\n\n### Comparing to Their Other Partners\n\n❌ \"Am I what you're looking for compared to your other partners?\"\n❌ \"Would I fit in with your polycule?\"\n❌ Making the conversation about competition\n\nFocus on the connection between you two.\n\n---\n\n## Red Flags to Watch\n\n### Concerning Signs\n\n- Vague about their existing relationships\n- Won't say what they're looking for\n- Dismissive about partner communication\n- Seems to be cheating rather than poly\n- Can't articulate their poly philosophy\n\n### Green Flags\n\n- Clear about their situation\n- Thoughtful about what they want\n- Communicative about their approach\n- Respectful of your questions\n- Understanding of different poly styles\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Should I ask about their other partners right away?**\nIt's appropriate to ask about their general setup early. Detailed questions about specific partners can wait until you've established some connection.\n\n**What if our poly styles don't match?**\nDiscuss whether the difference is workable. Some mismatches (hierarchical vs. solo poly) can work; others (completely incompatible availability) can't.\n\n**How do I know if they have space for me?**\nAsk directly: \"What does your capacity for a new connection look like?\" Good poly communication means being honest about bandwidth.\n\n**What if they're poly but their partner doesn't know?**\nThat's not polyamory—that's cheating. If you discover this, you can decide whether to continue, but know what you're getting into.\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [30 Feeld Conversation Starters That Actually Work](/feeld-guide/feeld-conversation-starters)\n- [How to Keep a Feeld Conversation Going](/feeld-guide/feeld-keep-conversation-going)\n- [Managing Time with Multiple Partners](/enm-communication/poly-time-systems)\n\n---\n\n## Find Your People\n\nConnecting with fellow poly folks can feel like coming home.
