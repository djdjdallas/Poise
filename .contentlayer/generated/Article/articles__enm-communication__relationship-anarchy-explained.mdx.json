    "raw": "\n\nRelationship anarchy (RA) is one of the most philosophically distinct approaches to relationships—and one of the most misunderstood. It's related to polyamory but goes further in questioning relationship assumptions entirely.\n\nThis guide explains what relationship anarchy actually means, how it differs from polyamory, and whether it might resonate with how you want to structure your connections.\n\n---\n\n## What Is Relationship Anarchy?\n\n**Relationship anarchy** is a philosophy that rejects societal rules about how relationships \"should\" be categorized and prioritized. RA practitioners:\n\n- Don't distinguish between romantic and platonic relationships by default\n- Reject prescribed hierarchies (friendship < romance < partnership)\n- Design each relationship based on what works for those involved\n- Question assumptions about what relationships \"should\" look like\n- Value autonomy and reject ownership/control dynamics\n\nThe term comes from a 2006 manifesto by Andie Nordgren and draws parallels to political anarchism: rejecting imposed hierarchies and rules in favor of freely chosen agreements.\n\n---\n\n## The Core Principles\n\n### 1. Love Is Abundant\n\nRA rejects the scarcity model of love:\n- Loving one person doesn't reduce love available for others\n- Relationships don't compete for a limited resource\n- You don't have to rank who you love \"most\"\n\n### 2. Relationship Hierarchy Is Constructed\n\nSociety says: romantic partner > close friend > casual friend > acquaintance\n\nRA asks: why? Who decided that? What if a friend is more important to me than a romantic partner?\n\n### 3. Each Relationship Is Unique\n\nRather than fitting relationships into boxes:\n- Each connection is defined by those in it\n- Labels are optional (or rejected entirely)\n- What you do together is more important than what you call it\n\n### 4. Autonomy Over Rules\n\nRA emphasizes:\n- Individual freedom in all relationships\n- Agreements over rules (collaboratively decided, not imposed)\n- Rejecting possessiveness or control\n- Each person's right to make their own choices\n\n### 5. No Relationship Is Inherently Superior\n\nA deep friendship can be as important as a sexual partnership. A short-term connection can be as meaningful as a decades-long one. Labels don't determine value.\n\n---\n\n## Relationship Anarchy vs. Polyamory\n\n| Aspect | Polyamory | Relationship Anarchy |\n|--------|-----------|---------------------|\n| **Multiple partners** | Yes | Possibly (but not required) |\n| **Romantic focus** | Usually | Questions the romance/friendship divide |\n| **Hierarchy** | Sometimes (primary/secondary) | Rejects prescribed hierarchy |\n| **Labels** | Often used (partner, metamour) | Minimized or rejected |\n| **Rules vs. agreements** | May have rules | Prefers agreements |\n| **Relationship categories** | Maintains romance as distinct | Questions all categories |\n\n### Key Difference\n\n**Polyamory** says: \"I can have multiple romantic/sexual relationships.\"\n\n**Relationship anarchy** says: \"I reject the premise that romantic relationships are inherently more important or different than other deep connections, and I'll define each relationship based on what it actually is rather than societal categories.\"\n\nYou can be both polyamorous and a relationship anarchist—but RA goes beyond just \"multiple partners\" to question the entire framework.\n\n---\n\n## What RA Looks Like in Practice\n\n### Challenging Assumptions\n\nAn RA practitioner might ask:\n- \"Why does dating automatically mean more commitment than friendship?\"\n- \"Why should I prioritize someone I have sex with over someone I don't?\"\n- \"Why do I need to label what this is?\"\n- \"Why should a relationship that's lasted longer automatically get priority?\"\n\n### Designing Custom Relationships\n\nRather than following scripts, each relationship is built from scratch:\n- \"What do we want from this connection?\"\n- \"What agreements serve us?\"\n- \"What can we each offer?\"\n- \"How do we want to relate to each other?\"\n\n### Practical Examples\n\n**Example 1:** Jordan has a person they live with (they share rent and domestic life), a person they have sex with occasionally, and a person they talk to every day for emotional support. To Jordan, none of these is automatically \"more important\"—each relationship is meaningful in its own way.\n\n**Example 2:** Sam doesn't distinguish between \"friends\" and \"partners.\" Every close relationship is defined by what they actually do together, not whether it includes sex or romance.\n\n---\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n\n### \"RA means no commitment\"\n\n**Wrong.** RA practitioners can be deeply committed—they just don't assume commitment must look a certain way or that romantic relationships automatically deserve more commitment than others.\n\n### \"RA means no rules\"\n\n**Nuanced.** RA prefers *agreements* (mutually decided) over *rules* (imposed). You can still have clear expectations—they're just collaboratively created.\n\n### \"RA means everyone is equal\"\n\n**Not quite.** Different relationships may get different amounts of time and energy based on what they need and what people can offer. The point is that these aren't predetermined by category.\n\n### \"RA is just polyamory being edgy\"\n\n**No.** RA questions foundations that polyamory often doesn't—particularly the privileged status of romantic/sexual relationships.\n\n---\n\n## Is RA Right for You?\n\n### RA Might Resonate If:\n\n- You've always questioned why romance is considered \"more\" than friendship\n- You resist labeling your relationships\n- You value autonomy highly\n- Relationship scripts have never felt right\n- You want each connection to define itself\n- You don't want to rank people by category\n\n### RA Might Not Fit If:\n\n- You want clear relationship categories\n- You prefer established structures\n- The romantic/friendship distinction matters to you\n- You want predictable relationship escalation\n- Labels help you understand your connections\n\n### Questions to Consider\n\n- Do I think romantic relationships should automatically have priority?\n- What would my relationships look like without societal expectations?\n- Do labels like \"partner\" or \"friend\" serve me, or do they limit me?\n- How would I design relationships if I started from scratch?\n\n---\n\n## Practicing RA While Dating\n\n### On Dating Apps\n\nHow to signal RA:\n- Mention relationship anarchy in your bio\n- Focus on what you're seeking without rigid labels\n- Be open about your philosophy early\n\n**Example bio:**\n> Relationship anarchist. I design each connection based on what it is, not what category it fits in. Looking for humans who value autonomy and reject scripts.\n\n### In Conversations\n\nBe prepared to explain:\n- What RA means to you\n- How you approach relationships\n- What you can offer\n- What you're not offering\n\n### Finding Compatible People\n\nLook for:\n- Others who question relationship norms\n- People comfortable with ambiguity\n- Those who value autonomy\n- Flexible, communicative people\n\n---\n\n## RA and Other Structures\n\n### RA + Polyamory\n\nMany people are both:\n- Multiple loving relationships (poly)\n- Rejecting hierarchy between them (RA)\n- Not privileging romance over friendship (RA)\n\n### RA + Solo Poly\n\nNatural combination:\n- No primary partner (solo poly)\n- No hierarchy (RA)\n- Autonomous relationship design (both)\n\nSee our [solo poly guide](/enm-communication/solo-poly-explained).\n\n### RA + Monogamy?\n\nTheoretically possible:\n- One romantic partner\n- But rejecting assumptions about what that means\n- Questioning friend/partner hierarchy\n- Rare in practice\n\n---\n\n## Criticisms of RA\n\n### \"It's unrealistic\"\n\nSome argue:\n- People need categories to understand relationships\n- Some relationships *are* more important\n- Complete autonomy ignores interconnection\n\n### \"It can hurt people\"\n\nConcerns include:\n- Partners feeling insecure without labels\n- Difficulty making shared life decisions\n- Seeming commitment-avoidant\n- Communication requiring more work\n\n### \"It's privileged\"\n\nCritique that:\n- RA assumes ability to reject legal/financial structures\n- Not everyone can ignore societal relationship benefits\n- Easy to theorize, harder for marginalized people\n\n---\n\n## More Relationship Structures\n\n- [ENM vs Polyamory](/enm-communication/enm-vs-polyamory)\n- [Solo Poly Explained](/enm-communication/solo-poly-explained)\n- [Hierarchical vs Non-Hierarchical Poly](/enm-communication/hierarchical-poly-guide)\n- [ENM Glossary](/enm-communication/enm-glossary)\n\n---\n\n## Communicate Your Philosophy\n\nWhether you're fully RA or just RA-curious, explaining your relationship philosophy takes skill.
