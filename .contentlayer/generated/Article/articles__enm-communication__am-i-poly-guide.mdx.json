It's a big question with no simple answer.\n\nThis guide offers honest self-assessment questions to help you explore.\n\n---\n\n## What This Guide Is (and Isn't)\n\n### What It Is\n\n- A tool for reflection\n- A starting point for deeper exploration\n- Questions to help clarify your feelings\n- Permission to be uncertain\n\n### What It Isn't\n\n- A definitive test\n- A way to prove you're \"really\" poly\n- A replacement for experience\n- The final word on your identity\n\n---\n\n## Understanding the Question\n\n### \"Am I Polyamorous?\" Can Mean Different Things\n\n**Do I have the capacity to love multiple people?**\nMost people can—polyamory is about whether you want to structure your life around it.\n\n**Is polyamory my orientation?**\nSome people feel polyamory is who they are; others see it as a choice they make.\n\n**Would polyamory make me happy?**\nThis is often the most useful question.\n\n**Can I do polyamory well?**\nCapacity and desire are different from execution.\n\n### A More Useful Frame\n\nInstead of \"Am I poly?\" ask:\n- \"Would polyamorous relationships serve me?\"\n- \"Am I drawn to this life structure?\"\n- \"Can I do the work polyamory requires?\"\n\n---\n\n## Self-Assessment Part 1: Your Feelings About Love\n\n### Questions to Reflect On\n\n**About loving multiple people:**\n- Have you felt romantic love for more than one person at the same time?\n- Did that feel natural, or conflicting and guilty?\n- Can you imagine loving multiple partners without comparison or hierarchy?\n\n**About partner's other loves:**\n- How do you feel imagining your partner loving someone else?\n- Can you distinguish discomfort from genuine harm?\n- Could you feel happy for a partner's joy with another?\n\n**About exclusivity:**\n- Does romantic exclusivity feel protective and good, or constraining?\n- When you imagine a lifetime of monogamy, how does it feel?\n- Have you felt limited by monogamous structures in past relationships?\n\n### What Your Answers Might Suggest\n\n**Strong poly indicators:**\n- Consistently felt love for multiple people\n- Exclusivity has felt constraining\n- Idea of partner's other loves brings curiosity, not just fear\n\n**Strong mono indicators:**\n- Exclusivity feels important and good\n- Other loves feel primarily threatening\n- One deep partnership is what you crave\n\n**Uncertain:**\n- Mixed feelings are normal\n- Real understanding often comes from experience\n- Uncertainty doesn't mean you shouldn't explore\n\n---\n\n## Self-Assessment Part 2: Your Motivations\n\n### Why Are You Considering Polyamory?\n\n**Reasons that often work well:**\n- Genuine desire for multiple meaningful relationships\n- Belief that love isn't scarce\n- Interest in the relationship style itself\n- Values alignment with non-monogamy\n\n**Reasons that often cause problems:**\n- Partner wants it and you're going along\n- Current relationship isn't working\n- Hoping to find \"better\" while keeping \"okay\"\n- Avoiding commitment or intimacy\n\n**Red flags for your motivation:**\n- You want polyamory so you can date, but hope partner doesn't\n- You see it as solution to specific relationship problems\n- You're running from something rather than toward something\n\n### Honest Reflection Questions\n\n- What do I hope to gain from polyamory?\n- What am I afraid of losing?\n- Would I still want this if my current relationship were perfect?\n- Am I excited about this, or just going along?\n\n---\n\n## Self-Assessment Part 3: Your Capacity\n\n### Polyamory Requires Specific Skills\n\n**Communication:**\n- Can you articulate your feelings clearly?\n- Can you have difficult conversations without shutting down?\n- Can you listen without defensiveness?\n\n**Emotional regulation:**\n- Can you feel difficult emotions without acting destructively?\n- Can you self-soothe when triggered?\n- Can you sit with discomfort rather than demanding immediate resolution?\n\n**Time management:**\n- Can you balance multiple priorities?\n- Are you organized with calendars and commitments?\n- Do you follow through on plans?\n\n**Self-awareness:**\n- Do you know your needs and boundaries?\n- Can you distinguish jealousy from other emotions?\n- Are you honest with yourself?\n\n### Capacity Assessment\n\nRate yourself 1-10 on each skill. Below 5 on any area suggests work to do before poly will go smoothly—though you can develop these skills over time.\n\n---\n\n## Self-Assessment Part 4: Your Circumstances\n\n### Is Now a Good Time?\n\n**Questions about current life:**\n- Do I have bandwidth for additional relationships?\n- Is my primary relationship (if any) stable?\n- Are there major life stressors that would complicate this?\n- Do I have support systems beyond romantic partners?\n\n**Questions about resources:**\n- Do I have time for multiple relationships?\n- Can I afford the cost of dating multiple people?\n- Is my living situation compatible?\n- Do I live somewhere with an ENM community?\n\n### Circumstantial Considerations\n\nEven if polyamory is right for you:\n- The timing might not be right\n- External factors matter\n- You can want something that doesn't currently fit your life\n\nThis doesn't mean \"never\"—it might mean \"not yet.\"\n\n---\n\n## Self-Assessment Part 5: Your Fears and Concerns\n\n### Common Fears Worth Examining\n\n**Fear: \"I'll get jealous and ruin everything\"**\nReality: Everyone experiences jealousy. It's manageable, not disqualifying.\n\n**Fear: \"My partner will find someone better\"**\nReality: This fear exists in monogamy too. It's about security, not relationship structure.\n\n**Fear: \"I'm not attractive/interesting enough for this\"**\nReality: Polyamory isn't a competition. Connection happens at all \"attractiveness\" levels.\n\n**Fear: \"I'll lose my current relationship\"**\nReality: Valid concern. Opening up does carry risk. So does staying closed.\n\n### Distinguishing Fears\n\n**Fears worth listening to:**\n- \"This doesn't feel right for me fundamentally\"\n- \"I'm doing this to please someone else\"\n- \"My relationship isn't stable enough\"\n\n**Fears to work through:**\n- \"I might feel jealous\" (yes, you will—that's normal)\n- \"It sounds hard\" (it is—but so is any meaningful thing)\n- \"What will people think?\" (their opinions aren't your life)\n\n---\n\n## Self-Assessment Part 6: Imagining the Reality\n\n### Visualization Exercise\n\nClose your eyes and imagine:\n\n**Scenario 1:** Your partner is on a date with someone new. They come home happy, with stories to share. How do you feel?\n\n**Scenario 2:** You have two partners you love deeply. Scheduling is complex but working. How do you feel?\n\n**Scenario 3:** A partner's other relationship is struggling, and they need support from you. How do you feel?\n\n**Scenario 4:** A metamour becomes important in your life—you care about each other. How do you feel?\n\n**Scenario 5:** It's hard—there's jealousy, scheduling conflicts, miscommunication. But you're working through it together. How do you feel?\n\n### What Your Visualizations Tell You\n\n- Consistent dread might mean mono is better for you\n- Mix of excitement and anxiety is normal for considering poly\n- Genuine curiosity and interest is a positive indicator\n- Imagining yourself happy in these scenarios matters\n\n---\n\n## After the Self-Assessment\n\n### If You Think Yes\n\n**Next steps:**\n- Continue learning (books, podcasts, community)\n- Talk with partner(s) if applicable\n- Start with low-stakes exploration\n- Build skills you identified as weak\n- Go slowly\n\n### If You Think No\n\n**That's valid:**\n- Monogamy is not inferior\n- Knowing yourself is valuable\n- You can revisit later if things change\n- There's no shame in choosing monogamy\n\n### If You're Still Uncertain\n\n**That's okay:**\n- Uncertainty is honest\n- Some clarity comes only from experience\n- You can explore cautiously\n- Give yourself permission not to know yet\n\n---\n\n## What Others Can't Tell You\n\n### Your Partner's Opinion\n\nThey may want you to be poly (or not). But their preference doesn't determine your identity.\n\n### The Internet's Opinion\n\nQuizzes and articles (including this one) are tools, not verdicts.\n\n### Society's Pressure\n\nNeither \"polyamory is evolution\" nor \"monogamy is the only way\" is universally true. Your relationship structure is yours to determine.\n\n---\n\n## Questions to Keep Asking\n\n### Ongoing Inquiry\n\nThis isn't a one-time assessment. Keep asking:\n- \"Is this working for me?\"\n- \"Am I happy?\"\n- \"What do I actually want?\"\n\n### Permission to Change\n\nYou might think you're poly and discover you're not. Or vice versa. Or discover something more nuanced. That's growth, not failure.\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [Solo Poly vs Single: What's the Difference?](/enm-communication/solo-poly-vs-single)\n- [The ENM Readiness Checklist](/enm-communication/enm-readiness-checklist)\n- [Relationship Anarchy Explained](/enm-communication/relationship-anarchy-guide)\n- [How to Label Your Relationship Style](/enm-communication/relationship-style-labels)\n\n---\n\n## Communicate Through Your Exploration\n\nWhatever you discover about yourself, communication is key.
