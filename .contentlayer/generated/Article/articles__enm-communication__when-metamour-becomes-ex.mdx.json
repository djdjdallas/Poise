    "raw": "\nYour partner and your metamour just broke up. Suddenly, the person who was part of your extended relationship structure is now... an ex. And you're caught in the middle.\n\nThis is one of polyamory's unique challenges. Here's how to navigate it.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Is Complicated\n\n### Multiple Relationships Affected\n\nA breakup between your partner and metamour affects:\n- Your partner (obviously)\n- Your metamour (obviously)\n- You (less obviously, but significantly)\n- Other metamours and polycule members\n- The overall relationship ecosystem\n\n### Conflicting Loyalties\n\nYou may feel pulled between:\n- Supporting your partner through their breakup\n- Your own relationship with the metamour\n- Maintaining neutrality\n- Honoring everyone's feelings\n\n### Your Feelings Are Valid\n\nYou might experience:\n- Relief (if the relationship was stressful)\n- Grief (if you'll miss your metamour)\n- Awkwardness (about the situation)\n- Worry (about your partner)\n- Guilt (for any feelings you have)\n\nAll of these are normal.\n\n---\n\n## Immediate Responses\n\n### For Your Partner\n\n**What they need:**\n- Space to process\n- Emotional support\n- No \"I told you so\" (even if you had concerns)\n- Patience with mood shifts\n\n**What to say:**\n> \"I'm here for you. What do you need right now?\"\n\n> \"This must be really hard. I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\n**What NOT to say:**\n> \"I never liked them anyway.\"\n> \"Now things can go back to normal.\"\n> \"At least you still have me.\"\n\n### For Yourself\n\nGive yourself permission to:\n- Have your own feelings about this\n- Need time to adjust\n- Grieve your relationship with the metamour\n- Feel complicated things\n\n**Talk to someone outside the situation** if you need to process without burdening your partner.\n\n### For Your Ex-Metamour (If Appropriate)\n\nIf you had a relationship with them, you might reach out:\n> \"Hey, I heard about you and [partner]. I'm sorry you're going through this. If you ever want to talk, I'm here—no pressure.\"\n\nCheck with your partner first about whether this is appropriate given the circumstances.\n\n---\n\n## Common Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: The Mutual, Amicable Ending\n\nThey both decided to end it. No major drama.\n\n**Your role:**\n- Support your partner's processing\n- Maintain your own connection to ex-metamour if desired\n- Help things stay civil\n\n**Challenge:** Not assuming \"amicable\" means \"easy.\" Grief exists even in mutual decisions.\n\n### Scenario 2: Your Partner Was Broken Up With\n\nYour partner was the one left.\n\n**Your role:**\n- Provide support and comfort\n- Manage any resentment toward your ex-metamour\n- Don't badmouth (tempting as it may be)\n\n**Challenge:** Balancing support with not feeding negativity.\n\n### Scenario 3: Your Partner Did the Breaking Up\n\nYour partner ended it.\n\n**Your role:**\n- Support their decision\n- Manage any relationship you have with ex-metamour\n- Not apologize for your partner's choices\n\n**Challenge:** Your ex-metamour may be hurt and you may be caught in the middle.\n\n### Scenario 4: It Was Messy\n\nDrama, conflict, maybe even betrayal was involved.\n\n**Your role:**\n- Support your partner\n- Maintain boundaries with ex-metamour\n- Not get drawn into the drama\n- Protect your own wellbeing\n\n**Challenge:** The temptation to take sides or get involved.\n\n---\n\n## What About Your Relationship With the Ex-Metamour?\n\n### Did You Have a Direct Friendship?\n\nIf you and your metamour had developed a genuine friendship:\n- You can maintain it (if appropriate and desired)\n- Discuss with your partner first\n- Be prepared for it to be complicated\n- Accept if it's not sustainable\n\n### Were You Kitchen Table Poly?\n\nIf you all spent time together:\n- That dynamic will change\n- Group activities may be awkward or impossible\n- You'll need new social patterns\n- This is a loss to grieve\n\n### Were You Parallel Poly?\n\nIf you didn't have much direct contact:\n- Less personal adjustment required\n- But still affects your partner and the ecosystem\n- May change logistics and scheduling\n\n---\n\n## Supporting Your Partner\n\n### What Usually Helps\n\n**Active listening** without trying to fix\n**Physical comfort** if they want it\n**Practical support** (cooking, chores, etc.)\n**Patience** with their emotional process\n**Consistency** in your relationship\n\n### What Usually Doesn't Help\n\n**Comparing** their grief to your feelings\n**Rushing** them through processing\n**Making it about you** too quickly\n**Minimizing** the loss\n**Solving** when they need to vent\n\n### The \"I'm Glad\" Trap\n\nIf you're secretly (or not so secretly) relieved about the breakup, be very careful:\n- Don't express this during their acute grief\n- They'll resent you for it later\n- Your relief is valid but needs to wait\n- Process it elsewhere (friends, therapist, journal)\n\n---\n\n## Adjusting Your Own Expectations\n\n### Time and Attention\n\nYour partner's breakup may temporarily affect your relationship:\n- They might need more support\n- They might be emotionally unavailable\n- They might have more time (or less, due to processing)\n- The dynamic will shift, at least temporarily\n\n### Your Processing\n\nYou're also going through something:\n- Loss of a metamour relationship\n- Potential schedule/logistics changes\n- Emotional labor of support\n- Adjustment to new normal\n\n**Make sure you're getting support too**, not just giving it.\n\n### NRE in Reverse\n\nJust as NRE can make a partner somewhat unavailable, breakup processing can too. Be patient, but also make sure your needs get met eventually.\n\n---\n\n## Polycule Dynamics\n\n### If You're All Connected\n\nWhen the polycule is intertwined:\n- Group events may be awkward\n- Taking sides creates fractures\n- Communication becomes crucial\n- Some relationships may need to pause\n\n### Managing Group Situations\n\nIf you'll still see the ex-metamour:\n- Agree on ground rules with your partner\n- Don't avoid them performatively\n- Keep things civil even if strained\n- Give it time\n\n### If Others Are Affected\n\nIf there are children, other metamours, or shared community:\n- Consider the broader impact\n- Don't force people to take sides\n- Protect what relationships can be protected\n- Accept that some things will change\n\n---\n\n## When You Had Issues With the Metamour\n\n### Relief Is Normal\n\nIf the metamour relationship was difficult, you might feel relieved. This is normal, but:\n- Don't express it during your partner's grief\n- Don't say \"I always knew\"\n- Process your relief privately\n- Be compassionate regardless\n\n### Historical Grievances\n\nIf you had conflicts with the ex-metamour:\n- This isn't the time to revisit them\n- Don't pile on with your partner\n- Let sleeping dogs lie\n- Focus on healing, not rehashing\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n### Taking Sides Publicly\n\nEven if you have a clear side internally, public side-taking creates drama.\n\n### Trying to Fix It\n\nUnless asked, don't try to mediate, get them back together, or solve the situation.\n\n### Making It About You\n\nYour feelings matter, but your partner's breakup is primarily their experience.\n\n### Rushing the Process\n\nGrief takes the time it takes. Don't impose timelines.\n\n### Cutting Off the Ex-Metamour Performatively\n\nUnless they did something genuinely harmful, cutting them off to prove loyalty is unnecessary and often unhealthy.\n\n---\n\n## When Your Partner Isn't Handling It Well\n\nIf your partner is:\n- Spiraling in unhealthy ways\n- Taking it out on you\n- Refusing to process\n- Engaging in destructive behavior\n\nYou can:\n- Express concern with compassion\n- Set boundaries around how you're treated\n- Suggest professional support\n- Give space if needed\n\nTheir breakup doesn't give them license to hurt you.\n\n---\n\n## Moving Forward\n\n### The New Normal\n\nEventually, things stabilize:\n- Your partner processes the grief\n- New rhythms emerge\n- The ex-metamour becomes a memory or a distant acquaintance\n- Life continues\n\n### What Changes\n\n- Schedules and logistics\n- Social dynamics\n- How your partner shows up\n- Your own relationship potentially\n\n### What Doesn't Have To Change\n\n- Your commitment to your partner\n- Your ability to support each other\n- The foundation of your relationship\n- Your capacity for other relationships\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Should I reach out to my ex-metamour?**\nDepends on your relationship with them and the breakup circumstances. When in doubt, ask your partner first.\n\n**What if I miss my metamour more than my partner seems to?**\nYour grief is valid regardless of their grief. Process it, but maybe not with your partner.\n\n**What if my partner wants to get back together with them?**\nThat's their choice. You can share feelings but not dictate.\n\n**How long should I wait to talk about my feelings about the breakup?**\nDepends on the acuteness of their grief. Usually a few weeks before shifting focus to your experience.\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [When Your Metamour Crosses a Boundary](/enm-communication/metamour-boundary-guide)\n- [How to Break Up in Polyamory](/enm-communication/poly-breakup-guide)\n- [Managing Time with Multiple Partners](/enm-communication/poly-time-systems)\n\n---\n\n## Navigate Change Together\n\nPolyamory means supporting partners through all kinds of transitions.
