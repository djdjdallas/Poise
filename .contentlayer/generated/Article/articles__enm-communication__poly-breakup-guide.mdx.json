    "raw": "\nBreaking up is hard. Breaking up in polyamory is harder—there are more relationships affected, more feelings to consider, and often more complexity about what \"ending\" even means. Maybe you're ending one relationship while maintaining others. Maybe you're leaving an entire polycule. Maybe you're closing a relationship rather than ending it.\n\nWhatever your situation, here's how to navigate a poly breakup with integrity.\n\n## Before the Breakup: Getting Clear\n\n### Know Why You're Ending It\n\nBe honest with yourself about your reasons:\n\n**Valid reasons for ending a poly relationship:**\n- Incompatible needs or life directions\n- Chronic unresolved conflict\n- Broken trust that can't be rebuilt\n- Wanting different things from the relationship\n- Not enough to give this relationship what it deserves\n- Personal growth requiring a different direction\n\n**Less valid reasons (that might need more exploration):**\n- Temporary rough patch you could work through\n- Pressure from other partners without your own conviction\n- Avoiding difficult conversations\n- Hoping they'll end it so you don't have to\n\n### Consider What \"Ending\" Means\n\nIn polyamory, breakups aren't always binary. Options include:\n\n**Full ending**: No contact, complete separation\n**Deescalation**: Moving from partners to friends, or from romantic to platonic\n**Restructuring**: Changing the nature of the relationship while maintaining connection\n**Taking a break**: Temporary pause to reassess\n\nKnow what you're actually proposing.\n\n### Think About the Wider Impact\n\nWho else is affected?\n\n- Your other partners\n- Their other partners\n- Shared metamours\n- Children (yours or theirs)\n- Mutual friends and community\n- Shared living situations\n\nYou can't control their reactions, but you can anticipate and plan.\n\n## Having the Conversation\n\n### Do It in Person\n\nUnless there's a safety reason not to, breakups deserve face-to-face conversation. Not text. Not ghosting. Not letting things just fade.\n\n### Choose the Right Setting\n\n- Private space where they can react emotionally\n- Not before they have obligations (work, childcare)\n- When you have time to actually talk, not a 15-minute window\n- Ideally when you won't be interrupted\n\n### Lead with Care, Then Clarity\n\nStart from a place of respect:\n\n> \"I care about you, and that's why I want to have this conversation honestly rather than letting things deteriorate.\"\n\nThen be clear:\n\n> \"I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I need to tell you that I don't think this relationship is working for me anymore. I want to talk about ending it, or significantly changing what we are to each other.\"\n\n### Don't:\n\n**Leave room for false hope** (if you're sure):\nNot: \"Maybe we could take a break and see...\"\nYes: \"I've made this decision and I'm not asking you to change my mind.\"\n\n**Blame or attack**:\nNot: \"You never had time for me and you were selfish about...\"\nYes: \"My needs weren't being met, and I don't think they can be in this structure.\"\n\n**Over-explain to the point of cruelty**:\nThey deserve honesty, not a detailed list of everything they did wrong.\n\n**Use the \"it's not you, it's me\" cop-out**:\nIf it is about them (or about the relationship), say so gently but honestly.\n\n### Expect Emotions\n\nThey might:\n- Be shocked (even if you think it was obvious)\n- Be angry\n- Cry\n- Ask lots of questions\n- Need time to process\n- React calmly (which doesn't mean they're fine)\n\nGive space for their reaction without abandoning your decision.\n\n## If You Have Other Partners\n\n### Tell Your Other Partners First (Usually)\n\nIn most situations, tell your other partners before or right after the breakup conversation:\n\n> \"I wanted to let you know that I've decided to end my relationship with [person]. We talked about it [today/are talking about it tonight]. I wanted you to know what's happening.\"\n\n### Don't Trash the Person You're Breaking Up With\n\nEven if they've been difficult, keep it factual:\n\n> \"It wasn't working for me. We wanted different things.\"\n\nNot:\n\n> \"They were so needy and jealous all the time and I couldn't take it anymore.\"\n\n### Manage Your Own Feelings\n\nYour other partners can support you, but don't make the breakup their primary burden. Process with friends, therapists, and support systems too.\n\n### Be Aware of Secondary Impacts\n\nYour breakup might affect:\n- Your other partners' sense of security\n- Scheduling and time availability\n- Group dynamics if there were shared connections\n- Your emotional availability\n\nCheck in and communicate about these effects.\n\n## Shared Metamours and Polycule Dynamics\n\n### If You Shared a Metamour\n\nDepending on the structure:\n- Give them a heads up (briefly, without making it their burden)\n- Don't ask them to take sides\n- Be clear about whether you want continued contact\n- Respect their relationship with your ex\n\n### If You're Leaving a Polycule\n\nThis is more complex:\n- Decide which individual relationships you're ending vs. maintaining\n- Communicate with each person directly\n- Be clear about what contact you want going forward\n- Recognize grief may be widespread\n\n### If Children Are Involved\n\nIf you've been part of a child's life:\n- Discuss with the parent(s) how to handle transitions\n- Don't disappear without closure (unless they ask you to)\n- Follow the parents' lead on continued involvement\n- Recognize kids grieve relationships too\n\n## The Logistics\n\n### Practical Matters to Address\n\n**If you lived together:**\n- Who stays, who leaves?\n- Timeline for moving out\n- How to divide shared possessions\n- Handling joint financial obligations\n\n**If you didn't live together:**\n- Returning each other's belongings\n- Shared subscriptions or accounts\n- Mutual events and spaces\n\n**In all cases:**\n- Social media (unfollowing, muting, etc.)\n- Mutual friends and communication about them\n- How/whether to tell family\n\n### Financial Disentanglement\n\nIf finances were intertwined:\n- Close or separate joint accounts\n- Resolve any debts or obligations\n- Divide shared property fairly\n\n## The Aftermath\n\n### Processing Your Own Grief\n\nEven if you initiated, breakups hurt. Allow yourself to grieve:\n- The relationship you had\n- The future you imagined\n- The identity of being with this person\n- The parts of your life that will change\n\n### Taking a Break from Dating\n\nConsider pausing new connections while you process. Jumping into new relationships to avoid grief usually backfires.\n\n### Supporting Your Other Partners\n\nYour breakup affects them too. They might:\n- Feel insecure about their own relationship with you\n- Grieve the loss of the polycule dynamic\n- Need reassurance\n\nCheck in, but don't make them your primary therapist.\n\n### Managing Post-Breakup Contact\n\nDecide what contact works for you:\n\n**No contact**: Clean break, at least for a while\n**Limited contact**: Logistical matters only\n**Gradual reconnection**: Space first, then possibly friendship later\n**Immediate friendship**: Rare, but possible for some\n\nWhat you need might differ from what they need. Communicate about it.\n\n## Special Situations\n\n### When They Don't Accept It\n\nIf your ex pushes back, stays persistent, or tries to negotiate:\n\n> \"I understand this is painful, and I'm not trying to hurt you. But I've made this decision and I'm not asking for input. I need you to respect that.\"\n\nYou don't need their agreement to end a relationship.\n\n### When There Was Betrayal or Harm\n\nIf the breakup involves broken trust or harmful behavior:\n- You don't owe an extensive explanation\n- You can keep the conversation short\n- You can use written communication if in-person feels unsafe\n- You can have a support person present\n\nYour safety and wellbeing come first.\n\n### When You Have to See Them\n\nIf you'll inevitably see your ex (small community, shared friends):\n- Discuss in advance how to handle encounters\n- Agree on basic civility even if not friendship\n- Don't make others choose sides\n- Consider which events you each will attend\n\n### When You Regret It\n\nSometimes you break up and then question the decision:\n- Give it time (at least 2-3 months) before reconsidering\n- Ask yourself what would actually be different\n- Don't approach them until you're certain\n- Accept they may have moved on\n\n## A Note on Ghosting\n\nDon't ghost a real relationship. Ghosting is:\n- Cruel\n- Cowardly\n- Damaging to someone who deserves clarity\n- Bad for your own integrity\n\nIf you've been dating briefly and it's clearly not going anywhere, a message is okay. But an established relationship deserves a conversation.\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**When should I bring up wanting to break up?**\nAs soon as you've decided, not after months of agonizing while they think everything's fine.\n\n**What if we have a shared event coming up?**\nEither skip the event or have the conversation first. Don't go through a weekend together knowing you're about to end things.\n\n**Should I wait until their NRE calms down before breaking up?**\nNo. You don't owe someone a relationship while they're distracted by someone else.\n\n**What if I'm not sure I want to break up?**\nThen talk about that—your doubts and struggles. But don't break up unless you're reasonably sure.\n\n---\n\nDifficult conversations require the right words.
