    "raw": "\n\nCouples looking for a third have a reputation problem. \"Unicorn hunting\" has become synonymous with treating single people as accessories rather than full humans—and many experienced ENM folks are rightfully wary.\n\nBut wanting to date as a couple isn't inherently unethical. The difference is in how you approach it. This guide covers how to use Feeld to find a third in a way that's respectful, honest, and actually attractive to the kind of people you want to meet.\n\n---\n\n## Why \"Unicorn Hunting\" Gets a Bad Name\n\nBefore fixing the problem, understand what you're avoiding:\n\n**Classic unicorn hunter behaviors:**\n- Treating the third as an addition to your relationship rather than a person\n- Expecting the third to date both of you equally with no independent relationships\n- Having a \"veto\" where either partner can end things unilaterally\n- Expecting more emotional labor from the third than you give\n- Disappearing when the relationship becomes inconvenient\n- Prioritizing the couple's comfort over the third's needs\n\n**Why people avoid couples:**\n- Past bad experiences with the above\n- Feeling like a sex toy rather than a person\n- Being disposed of when the couple has issues\n- Unequal power dynamics\n- Lack of respect for their autonomy\n\n---\n\n## The Ethical Alternative\n\nEthical couple dating means:\n\n### Treating the Third as a Full Person\n\nThey have their own:\n- Needs and boundaries\n- Time constraints and priorities\n- Other relationships (potentially)\n- Right to say no to anything\n- Value beyond what they add to your relationship\n\n### Offering Something Real\n\nWhat are you actually offering a third?\n- Two people who care about their wellbeing?\n- Genuine connection and good times?\n- Flexibility in how the relationship develops?\n- Respect for their autonomy?\n\nIf you can't articulate what's in it for them, reconsider your approach.\n\n### Being Flexible About Structure\n\nThe best couple-third dynamics often look different than expected:\n- The third might connect more with one partner\n- Relationships might develop at different speeds\n- Group activities might not be the main event\n- The dynamic will evolve over time\n\nRigid expectations (\"we all have to do everything together always\") are red flags.\n\n---\n\n## Setting Up Your Feeld Profiles\n\n### Both Partners Need Quality Profiles\n\nDon't create one shared profile—use Feeld's pairing feature:\n\n1. Each partner creates an individual profile\n2. Link your profiles together\n3. Both profiles should be complete and compelling\n\n**Why individual profiles matter:**\n- Shows you're both real, invested people\n- Potential thirds can learn about each of you\n- Signals you understand how Feeld works\n- Feels less like being approached by an entity\n\n### What Each Profile Needs\n\n**Photos:**\n- Clear individual photos of each person\n- At least one photo together\n- Each person should look good (not just one partner)\n\n**Bio:**\n- Who you are as an individual\n- Brief mention of your couple situation\n- What you're looking for\n- Something that invites conversation\n\n**Desires:**\n- Singles (if seeking individuals)\n- Threesome (if applicable)\n- Open relationship\n- Whatever accurately describes what you want\n\nFor more profile setup, see our [Feeld for couples guide](/feeld-guide/feeld-for-couples).\n\n---\n\n## Your Bio: What to Say\n\n### Be Honest About Your Situation\n\n**Include:**\n- That you're a couple\n- How long you've been together\n- Your experience level with ENM\n- What you're genuinely looking for\n\n**Example:**\n> Together 5 years, exploring ENM for 2. We date together and separately—looking for someone who might enjoy both. No pressure on what that becomes.\n\n### Be Clear About Flexibility\n\nSignal that you're not rigid:\n\n> We've learned that the best connections have their own shape. Open to seeing what develops.\n\n> Looking for connection first, and we'll figure out what that looks like together.\n\n### Avoid Red Flag Language\n\n**Don't say:**\n- \"Looking for our third\" (possessive)\n- \"Must be attracted to both of us equally\" (unrealistic)\n- \"No drama\" (dismissive)\n- \"Looking for a unicorn\" (even ironically, it's a red flag)\n\n**Do say:**\n- \"Looking for someone who might click with us\"\n- \"Open to connections developing naturally\"\n- \"Interested in people who want to get to know both of us\"\n\n---\n\n## Approaching Potential Thirds\n\n### First Message Matters\n\nYour opening message should:\n- Be from one person (not \"we\")\n- Reference something specific from their profile\n- Not immediately mention sex or threesomes\n- Treat them like a person you want to know\n\n**Bad opener:**\n> Hey! We think you're hot. Want to join us? 😏\n\n**Better opener:**\n> Hi! I noticed you're into hiking too—have you done any good trails lately? I'm [name], partnered with [partner]. Thought your profile was great and wanted to say hi.\n\n### When to Mention the Couple Situation\n\nIf your profiles are paired, they already know. You can:\n- Let them bring it up\n- Mention naturally in conversation\n- Answer questions honestly when asked\n\nDon't make every message about your couple status.\n\n### Responding to Questions\n\nCommon questions you'll get:\n- \"What are you looking for?\"\n- \"How does this work with your partner?\"\n- \"Do you date separately?\"\n- \"What happens if one of you catches feelings?\"\n\nHave thoughtful answers ready. Vague responses signal you haven't thought this through.\n\n---\n\n## Building an Ethical Dynamic\n\n### Early Conversations Should Establish\n\n- What everyone is looking for\n- How communication will work\n- Whether separate connections are okay\n- How you'll handle challenges\n- That the third can always set boundaries\n\n### Ongoing Practices\n\n- Check in with the third about their experience\n- Don't gang up in disagreements\n- Give the third space to connect with each partner\n- Respect their other relationships and time\n- Be responsive to feedback\n\n### Red Flags You Might Be Missing\n\nAsk yourselves:\n- Are we treating [third] the same way we'd want to be treated?\n- Would we be comfortable if the roles were reversed?\n- Is [third] getting as much out of this as we are?\n- Are we making assumptions about their availability?\n\n---\n\n## What Ethical Thirds Are Looking For\n\nPeople open to dating couples typically want:\n\n**Genuine connection** - Not just being a sexual experience\n\n**Respect for their time** - Not assumed to be always available\n\n**Clear communication** - Knowing where they stand\n\n**Flexibility** - Room for the relationship to be what it is\n\n**Safety** - Emotional and physical\n\n**Autonomy** - Not being controlled or possessed\n\nIf you can offer these things, say so in your profile and demonstrate them in your behavior.\n\n---\n\n## Handling Challenges\n\n### When There's Unequal Connection\n\nIt's common for a third to connect more with one partner. Options:\n- Accept that relationships develop differently\n- Give space for individual connections\n- Don't force equal feelings\n- Communicate openly about dynamics\n\n**Don't:** Make the third feel guilty for natural chemistry\n\n### When Your Relationship Has Issues\n\nYour couple problems shouldn't become the third's problems:\n- Don't use them as a relationship band-aid\n- Don't put them in the middle of conflicts\n- Don't disappear when things get hard\n- Be honest if you need to pause\n\n### When It's Not Working\n\nEnd things ethically:\n- Have real conversations (not just ghosting)\n- Acknowledge their feelings\n- Thank them for the time you shared\n- Don't blame them for couple issues\n\n---\n\n## The Long Game\n\nBuilding a reputation as ethical couple daters:\n- Word travels in ENM communities\n- Past thirds may recommend you to friends\n- Your behavior now affects future options\n- Being ethical is its own reward\n\n---\n\n## Finding Your Person\n\nEthical couple dating is harder than treating people like objects—but it's the only approach that leads to genuinely good connections.\n\nPoise helps couples write profiles that attract the right people and navigate conversations about tricky dynamics. Because finding a third is hard enough without communication struggles.\n\n[Download Poise and approach couple dating ethically.](/download)\n",
