    "raw": "\nIn monogamy, defining the relationship usually means one question: \"Are we exclusive?\" In polyamory, it's more complicated. What does \"defining the relationship\" even mean when multiple relationships are possible?\n\nHere's how to navigate the DTR conversation in ENM.\n\n---\n\n## What \"Defining the Relationship\" Means in ENM\n\n### Not the Same as Monogamy\n\nIn monogamy, DTR often means:\n- Are we dating exclusively?\n- Are we boyfriend/girlfriend?\n- Is this going somewhere?\n\nIn ENM, the questions are different:\n- What are we to each other?\n- How does this relationship fit into our lives?\n- What can we expect from each other?\n- What words do we use?\n\n### What You're Actually Defining\n\n**Possible topics:**\n- What to call each other (partner, boyfriend/girlfriend, friend, lover, etc.)\n- Where this relationship sits in your life structure\n- What expectations come with this connection\n- What this relationship means to both of you\n- How integrated your lives will be\n- What's on the table (romance, sex, partnership, etc.)\n\n---\n\n## When to Have the Conversation\n\n### Too Early\n\n**Signs it's too soon:**\n- You've only been on a few dates\n- There isn't enough foundation to define\n- You're trying to lock something down from insecurity\n- Neither person has enough information to know what they want\n\n**Too-early conversations often:**\n- Create pressure\n- Get vague answers because people genuinely don't know yet\n- Feel forced\n\n### Too Late\n\n**Signs you've waited too long:**\n- One person has been operating under assumptions that don't match reality\n- There's growing uncertainty that's creating anxiety\n- You're avoiding a conversation you both need\n- Misaligned expectations have caused hurt\n\n**Waiting too long risks:**\n- Growing in different directions without realizing\n- Building on a foundation of different assumptions\n- One person feeling strung along\n\n### The Right Time\n\n**Good indicators:**\n- You've spent enough time together to have feelings and opinions\n- There's genuine curiosity about where this is going\n- Questions are arising naturally (for one or both people)\n- The relationship is developing and needs some navigation\n\n**The right time feels like:** A natural progression, not a forced milestone.\n\n---\n\n## ENM-Specific DTR Questions\n\n### Questions About Labels\n\n**What to explore:**\n- What do you want to call this?\n- How do you introduce me to others?\n- What words feel right for our connection?\n- What labels matter to you?\n\n**ENM-specific considerations:**\n- Labels mean different things in poly contexts\n- \"Partner\" can range from casual to life partner\n- Some people avoid labels; others find them important\n- Your other partners may affect how you define this one\n\n### Questions About Structure\n\n**What to explore:**\n- Where does this relationship fit in your life structure?\n- Is this a primary partnership, or something different?\n- How much time and energy are available for this connection?\n- What does this relationship have potential to become?\n\n**ENM-specific considerations:**\n- Some people practice hierarchy; others don't\n- \"Secondary\" means different things to different people\n- Available bandwidth matters\n- Other relationships affect this one\n\n### Questions About Expectations\n\n**What to explore:**\n- What can we expect from each other?\n- How much communication? How much time?\n- What commitments are we making?\n- What's off the table?\n\n**ENM-specific considerations:**\n- Expectations vary widely across relationship types\n- Clear expectations prevent resentment\n- Your capacity may be limited by other commitments\n- Different relationships can have different expectations\n\n### Questions About Future\n\n**What to explore:**\n- What do you see happening with us?\n- Is this something that might grow, or is it defined as what it is?\n- What are your hopes for this connection?\n- What would you not want this to become?\n\n**ENM-specific considerations:**\n- Not all relationships need to escalate\n- Some connections are complete as they are\n- Multiple relationships can have different trajectories\n- The \"relationship escalator\" is optional\n\n---\n\n## How to Have the Conversation\n\n### Starting the Conversation\n\n**Direct approach:**\n> \"I'd like to talk about what we are to each other. I've been thinking about it and I'm curious where your head is.\"\n\n**Soft approach:**\n> \"I've been enjoying our time together. I'm curious what you see happening between us?\"\n\n**Specific approach:**\n> \"Someone asked me about you and I didn't know what to say. Can we talk about how we describe this?\"\n\n### Sharing Your Perspective\n\n**Lead with your position:**\n> \"Here's where I am: I really like spending time with you, and I'd like this to be a more defined relationship. What do you think?\"\n\n**But stay open:**\n> \"I have some thoughts, but I want to hear where you are too before I share everything.\"\n\n### Asking About Theirs\n\n**Open questions:**\n> \"How do you think about us?\"\n> \"What does this relationship feel like to you?\"\n> \"What would you want from a defined connection with me?\"\n\n**Listen fully before responding.**\n\n### Finding Alignment\n\n**If you're aligned:**\n> \"It sounds like we want similar things. Let's talk about what that looks like specifically.\"\n\n**If you're not:**\n> \"It sounds like we're in different places with this. Can we talk about what that means?\"\n\n---\n\n## Common DTR Scenarios in ENM\n\n### Scenario 1: Becoming Partners\n\n**Situation:** You've been dating casually and want more.\n\n**The conversation:**\n> \"I've really valued our connection. I'm interested in being more intentional—calling you my partner, having you be a real part of my life. How would you feel about that?\"\n\n### Scenario 2: Clarifying Status\n\n**Situation:** You've been seeing each other regularly but haven't named it.\n\n**The conversation:**\n> \"We've been spending a lot of time together and I realize I'm not sure what to call us. What feels right to you?\"\n\n### Scenario 3: Addressing Assumptions\n\n**Situation:** You're worried you're on different pages.\n\n**The conversation:**\n> \"I want to make sure we're aligned on what this is. I've been thinking of us as [your assumption]. Is that how you see it too?\"\n\n### Scenario 4: Resisting Definition\n\n**Situation:** They or you don't want to define things.\n\n**The conversation (if you're the one resisting):**\n> \"I understand the desire to define this. I'm not ready for that conversation yet because [reason]. Can we revisit in [timeframe]?\"\n\n**The conversation (if they're resisting):**\n> \"I'd like some clarity on what we are. If you're not sure or not ready, that's okay—but I need to know that we'll get there eventually.\"\n\n---\n\n## What If You Want Different Things?\n\n### Misaligned Definitions\n\n**Common misalignments:**\n- One wants partnership; one wants casual\n- One wants more time; one has no more bandwidth\n- One wants labels; one avoids them\n- One sees potential; one sees a ceiling\n\n### Navigating Differences\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Compromise:** Find a middle ground that works for both\n2. **Adjust expectations:** Accept the relationship for what it is\n3. **Wait and see:** Give it more time before deciding\n4. **End it:** If needs are too different, part ways\n\n**The key:** Honesty about what each person actually wants, not what they think they should want.\n\n---\n\n## After Defining\n\n### What Changes\n\n**When you've defined the relationship:**\n- Clearer expectations\n- Labels to use with others\n- Shared understanding of what this is\n- Foundation for addressing future questions\n\n### What Stays the Same\n\n**Defining doesn't mean:**\n- Everything is figured out forever\n- No more conversations needed\n- The relationship is locked in place\n- Nothing can change\n\n**Relationships continue to evolve.** Definitions can too.\n\n### Revisiting\n\n**Plan to check in:**\n- \"Let's revisit this in a few months to see how it's working.\"\n- \"If anything changes for either of us, let's talk.\"\n- \"This is our starting point, not our forever answer.\"\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**What if they don't want to define things?**\nSome people genuinely need more time; others avoid definition as a pattern. Ask for a timeline: \"When would you be ready to talk about this?\"\n\n**How is DTR different with multiple partners?**\nEach relationship deserves its own definition. Don't assume one relationship's definition applies to another.\n\n**What if defining creates hierarchy I don't want?**\nYou can define without hierarchy. \"Partner\" doesn't have to mean more important than other partners.\n\n**What if I don't know what I want?**\nSay that honestly. \"I'm still figuring out what I want from this. Can we keep exploring and revisit?\"\n\n---\n\n## Related Guides\n\n- [Being Emotionally Available While Dating](/authentic-connection/emotional-availability-dating)\n- [How to Have Difficult Conversations in Polyamory](/enm-communication/difficult-conversations-poly)\n- [Rejecting the Relationship Escalator](/enm-communication/relationship-escalator-enm)\n\n---\n\n## Clarity Creates Connection\n\nDefining the relationship isn't about locking things down—it's about understanding each other.
