    "raw": "\n\nWhen you set up your Feeld profile, you'll encounter two separate sections: Desires and Interests. At first glance, they might seem similar—both are tags you select to tell potential matches something about yourself. But they serve fundamentally different purposes, and understanding the distinction can significantly improve your matching experience.\n\nThis guide breaks down exactly what Desires and Interests mean on Feeld, how to choose them strategically, and how to use both sections to attract the connections you're actually looking for.\n\n---\n\n## The Basic Distinction\n\nLet's start with the fundamental difference:\n\n**Desires** = What you're looking for in intimate/romantic connections\n**Interests** = What you enjoy doing in your daily life (hobbies, passions)\n\nThink of it this way: Desires answer \"What are you seeking from connections on this app?\" while Interests answer \"Who are you as a person outside the bedroom?\"\n\nBoth matter for compatibility, but they serve different filtering and matching functions.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding Desires\n\nDesires on Feeld are the intimate, romantic, and sexual aspects of what you're seeking. They're the heart of why you're on Feeld rather than a mainstream dating app.\n\n### What Desires Include\n\nFeeld's Desire tags typically cover:\n\n**Relationship Structures:**\n- Monogamy\n- Non-monogamy\n- Polyamory\n- Open relationship\n- Relationship anarchy\n\n**Connection Types:**\n- Casual\n- Friends with benefits\n- Something ongoing\n- Serious relationship\n- Life partner\n\n**Experience-Based:**\n- Threesomes\n- Group experiences\n- Couples dating\n- Being a third\n\n**Orientation/Identity:**\n- Heteroflexible\n- Homoflexible\n- Pansexual\n- Demisexual\n- Sapiosexual\n\n**Kink Categories:**\n- BDSM\n- Power dynamics\n- Exhibitionism\n- Voyeurism\n- Specific practices\n\n### How Desires Affect Matching\n\nFeeld uses Desires to influence who you see and who sees you. When your Desires align with another user's, you're more likely to appear in each other's feeds. Mismatched Desires can mean missed connections—or connections that don't go anywhere.\n\n**Example:** If you select \"Casual\" as a Desire and someone else selects \"Life partner,\" Feeld may deprioritize showing you to each other, recognizing the potential incompatibility.\n\n### Strategic Desire Selection\n\n**Be Honest, Not Aspirational**\n\nSelect Desires that reflect what you're actually looking for right now—not what you think might be interesting someday or what sounds good on paper.\n\nIf you're new to kink, selecting every BDSM-related Desire will attract experienced people looking for experienced partners. You'll waste their time and feel in over your head.\n\n**Cast the Right Net**\n\nToo few Desires means fewer potential matches. Too many Desires means matches that aren't aligned. Find the balance:\n\n- Select your primary Desires (the non-negotiables)\n- Add secondary Desires (things you're genuinely open to)\n- Skip anything that's \"maybe someday\"\n\n**Understand the Signals**\n\nSome Desires send specific signals:\n\n- \"Casual\" = not looking for emotional commitment\n- \"Something ongoing\" = more than one-night stands\n- \"Life partner\" = serious, committed intentions\n\nChoose based on what you want people to understand about your intentions.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding Interests\n\nInterests on Feeld are your hobbies, passions, and personality markers—the things that make up your life outside of romantic/sexual connection.\n\n### What Interests Include\n\nFeeld's Interest tags typically cover:\n\n**Activities:**\n- Hiking\n- Yoga\n- Cycling\n- Dancing\n- Gaming\n\n**Cultural:**\n- Live music\n- Art\n- Theater\n- Film\n- Reading\n\n**Lifestyle:**\n- Travel\n- Cooking\n- Wine/cocktails\n- Cannabis\n- Fitness\n\n**Intellectual:**\n- Philosophy\n- Science\n- Psychology\n- Spirituality\n- Politics\n\n**Social:**\n- Parties\n- Festivals\n- Board games\n- Dinner parties\n\n### Why Interests Matter\n\nInterests serve several functions:\n\n**Conversation Starters**\nWhen someone messages you, shared Interests give them something to talk about. \"I see you're into ceramics—I just started throwing last year\" is a lot better than \"hey.\"\n\n**Compatibility Indicators**\nBeyond intimate compatibility, you probably want to actually enjoy spending time with people you connect with. Shared Interests suggest compatible lifestyles.\n\n**Personality Windows**\nYour Interests tell a story about who you are. Someone who lists \"hiking, meditation, gardening\" paints a different picture than someone who lists \"clubbing, cocktails, fashion.\"\n\n**Filtering Beyond the Bedroom**\nTwo people might have perfectly aligned Desires but nothing to talk about. Interests help you find people you'll enjoy even when you're not being intimate.\n\n### Strategic Interest Selection\n\n**Be Specific**\n\n\"Music\" tells people almost nothing. \"Jazz vinyl collecting\" tells them something specific they can connect with.\n\nIf Feeld only offers broad categories, use your bio to add specificity.\n\n**Reflect Your Reality**\n\nDon't select Interests you wish you had. If you haven't been hiking in three years, don't list hiking. You'll end up on dates where you're exposed.\n\n**Show Range**\n\nA mix of Interests paints a fuller picture:\n- Something active (cycling)\n- Something creative (photography)\n- Something social (dinner parties)\n- Something contemplative (reading)\n\nThis shows you're a dimensional person with a real life.\n\n**Consider What Matters for Compatibility**\n\nSome Interests are more compatibility-relevant than others:\n\n- Cannabis use might matter for lifestyle alignment\n- Festival culture signals specific social preferences\n- Fitness levels might affect shared activities\n\nThink about which Interests actually matter for the connections you're seeking.\n\n---\n\n## Desires vs. Interests: A Direct Comparison\n\n| Aspect | Desires | Interests |\n|--------|---------|-----------|\n| Purpose | What you want from connections | Who you are as a person |\n| Focus | Intimate/romantic/sexual | Hobbies/lifestyle/personality |\n| Matching | Affects algorithm priority | Provides conversation hooks |\n| Filtering | Core compatibility | Lifestyle compatibility |\n| Privacy level | More intimate/personal | More shareable/casual |\n\n---\n\n## How They Work Together\n\nThe most effective Feeld profiles use Desires and Interests in harmony. Here's how:\n\n### Desires Set Expectations\n\nYour Desires tell someone: \"This is the kind of connection I'm looking for. Are we aligned?\"\n\nIf they're not aligned on Desires, matching Interests won't save the connection. You might have great conversations about shared hobbies, but if one person wants casual and the other wants commitment, it's not going anywhere.\n\n### Interests Build Connection\n\nOnce Desires establish basic compatibility, Interests determine whether you'll actually enjoy each other's company.\n\nYou might find someone whose Desires perfectly match yours, but if you have zero Interests in common, dates might feel flat. You're compatible on paper but not in practice.\n\n### The Ideal Match\n\nThe best Feeld connections often have:\n- Aligned core Desires (you want similar things)\n- Some overlapping Interests (you have things to do and talk about)\n- Some different Interests (you can introduce each other to new things)\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n### Mistake 1: Treating Them as Interchangeable\n\nSome people fill out one section thoroughly and ignore the other. This creates an incomplete picture and limits your matching potential.\n\n**Fix:** Give equal attention to both sections.\n\n### Mistake 2: Selecting Everything\n\nIf you select every Desire and Interest available, you're essentially selecting nothing. You're not helping anyone understand who you are or what you want.\n\n**Fix:** Be selective. Choose tags that are genuinely true and important.\n\n### Mistake 3: Conflicting Signals\n\nSometimes people's Desires don't match their bio, or their Interests seem inconsistent with their photos. This creates confusion.\n\n**Example:** Selecting \"Casual only\" as a Desire but writing in your bio about wanting a deep, meaningful connection.\n\n**Fix:** Ensure Desires, Interests, bio, and photos tell a consistent story.\n\n### Mistake 4: Never Updating\n\nYour Desires and Interests can change over time. What you wanted when you joined Feeld might not be what you want now.\n\n**Fix:** Review and update periodically, especially after significant life changes or shifts in what you're seeking.\n\n### Mistake 5: Using Desires as a Wishlist\n\nSome people use Desires to list everything they might ever be interested in, rather than what they're actively seeking.\n\n**Fix:** Focus on current, active Desires. You can always add more as you explore.\n\n---\n\n## Specific Scenarios\n\n### For Singles Seeking Singles\n\n**Desires to consider:**\n- Relationship type (casual, ongoing, serious)\n- Orientation/attraction\n- Any specific experiences you're seeking\n\n**Interests focus:**\n- Activities you'd enjoy doing together\n- Lifestyle indicators (social/homebody, active/relaxed)\n- Conversation and connection points\n\n### For Couples Dating Together\n\n**Desires to consider:**\n- What you're both open to\n- Type of connection (one-time, ongoing, potentially romantic)\n- Specific dynamics you're interested in\n\n**Interests focus:**\n- What you enjoy doing as a couple\n- What a third might join you for\n- Shared versus individual interests\n\n### For People in Open Relationships (Dating Separately)\n\n**Desires to consider:**\n- Your individual desires (separate from your partner's)\n- Relationship style (ENM, poly, etc.)\n- What you're personally looking for\n\n**Interests focus:**\n- Your individual hobbies and passions\n- What you'd want to share with new connections\n- Who you are apart from your primary relationship\n\n### For Kink-Focused Users\n\n**Desires to consider:**\n- Specific kinks and practices\n- Role (dominant, submissive, switch)\n- Experience level\n\n**Interests focus:**\n- Kink community involvement\n- Related lifestyle elements\n- Non-kink personality and hobbies\n\n---\n\n## How to Review Your Current Selections\n\nIf you've already filled out your profile, here's how to audit it:\n\n### Step 1: Review Your Desires\n\n- Are they accurate to what you want right now?\n- Are any outdated or aspirational rather than real?\n- Are you missing any core Desires?\n- Do they tell a clear story about what you're seeking?\n\n### Step 2: Review Your Interests\n\n- Do they reflect your actual life?\n- Would you be comfortable talking about all of them?\n- Do they give someone conversation starters?\n- Do they paint a picture of who you are?\n\n### Step 3: Check for Consistency\n\n- Do your Desires and Interests align with your bio?\n- Do your photos support the story your tags tell?\n- Would someone get a clear picture of who you are?\n\n### Step 4: Get Feedback\n\nIf you have friends who use Feeld or understand the platform, ask them to review your profile. Sometimes others spot inconsistencies we miss.\n\n---\n\n## Advanced Strategy: Using Tags for Filtering\n\nBeyond what tags mean to others, they also affect who Feeld shows you. Here's how to use that strategically:\n\n### Narrow When You're Overwhelmed\n\nIf you're getting too many connections that don't align, make your Desires more specific. Fewer tags means more targeted matching.\n\n### Broaden When You're Curious\n\nIf you're open to exploring, add Desires you're genuinely curious about. You might discover connections you wouldn't have found otherwise.\n\n### Use Interests for Search\n\nSome users search by specific Interests. Having detailed Interests makes you findable to people specifically looking for partners with shared hobbies.\n\n---\n\n## The Bigger Picture\n\nDesires and Interests aren't just about gaming the algorithm or attracting more matches. They're about clarity and communication.\n\nThe clearer you are about what you want (Desires) and who you are (Interests), the more likely you are to find connections that actually work. Vagueness might seem like it keeps options open, but it usually just creates mismatched expectations.\n\nBe honest, be specific, and trust that the right people will be attracted to the real you—Desires, Interests, and all.\n\n---\n\n## Need Help Putting It All Together?\n\nYour Desires and Interests are just part of the picture. Poise helps you craft the rest—from bios that bring your tags to life to openers that reference shared Interests naturally.\n\n[Download Poise and make your Feeld profile work harder.](/download)\n",
